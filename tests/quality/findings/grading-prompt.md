I'm building a solution to answer rules questions regarding the KIll Team boardgame. I have several different solutions. You are given sample outputs of each. Compare and grade these outputs in terms of:
- How easy it to follow the logic of the explanation
- Does to logic make sense?
- How compact the answer is
The outcome of the ruling is irrelevant.
