  Would the Curtain Falls firefight ploy still cost CP even after the Nemesis Claw chain snare
  equipment potentially would block the free fall back action?
ground_truth_answers:
  - No, the Curtain Falls firefight ploy still cost CP even if the Nemesis Claw chain snare equipment blocks the free fall back action.
ground_truth_contexts:
  # Chain Snare rule
  - Whenever an enemy operative would perform the Fall Back action while within control range of a friendly NEMESIS CLAW operative
  # Curtain Falls rule
  - End that sequence (any remaining attack dice are discarded) and immediately perform a free Dash or Fall Back action up to 3" with that operative
  # FAQ
  - If a rule would prevent an action from being performed 'during that activation/counteraction' (e.g. NEMESIS CLAW Chain Snares)
