Each third thereafter can be set up above: place them to one side instead of in the killzone. For each third that's set up above, you must set up the whole third in this way (not some of them), then place one of your Drop markers **wholly within** your drop zone.\n\nAs a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in the first and second turning point, you can move your Drop markers up to 4\" horizontally. In a killzone that uses the close quarters rules (e.g. Killzone: Gallowdark), this can be measured and moved through Wall terrain.\n\nIn the Firefight phase, friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operatives set up above are activated as normal. When you do, you can either expend or land that operative. If it lands, set it up in the killzone in a location it can be placed as follows (it's no longer set up above):\n*   **Within 3\"** horizontally of one of your Drop markers, or **wholly within** your drop zone.\n*   Not within **control range** of enemy operatives (unless you're setting up a **PRECURSOR** operative, which can be set up within **control range** of an enemy operative).\n*   With no part of its base underneath **Vantage** terrain.\n*   With an order of your choice.\n\nThe operative is treated as performing the **Reposition** action (spend the AP accordingly), then continue its activation as normal. It's **obscured** until the end of the next activation or the end of the turning point (whichever comes first).\n\nLess than half of your operatives can be set up above by the end of the first turning point. In other words, by the end of the first turning point, more than half of your operatives must have been set up in the killzone during the battle.\n\nWhen readying your operatives during the second and third turning points, remove one of your Drop markers.

Only one operative can be on it at once, and whilst an operative is on it, that operative cannot touch the killzone floor (in other words, an operative can't be both on the teleport pad and on the killzone floor). Equipment terrain features cannot be set up **within 2\"** of a teleport pad. Whenever an operative's base is touching a teleport pad, if another operative is on that teleport pad, those operatives are treated as being within each other's control range.\n\nFrom the start of the **second turning point**, whenever a friendly operative on a teleport pad performs the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, you can teleport it. If you do, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up on the other teleport pad. It must still fulfil all other requirements of that action, otherwise it cannot teleport (e.g. if it's the **Charge** action, the operative must finish that action within control range of an enemy operative). If another operative is on the other teleport pad when an operative teleports, swap them around (if it's an enemy operative, its controlling player sets it up).\n\n[Derived from illustration]\n**Teleport Pad Exclusivity:**\nAn operative on a teleport pad has its base entirely on the pad and does not touch the killzone floor. This is a mutually exclusive state - the operative is either on the pad OR on the floor, never both.\n\n**Teleportation Requirements:**\nTeleportation is not free movement. The operative must still meet all action requirements (e.g., for Charge, ending within control range of an enemy). The teleportation replaces the movement portion but not the action's other conditions.\n\n**Teleportation Availability:**\nTeleportation only becomes available from the start of the second turning point onwards. During the first turning point, teleport pads function as normal terrain but cannot be used for teleportation.\n\n---",

The question also concerns whether the Technoarcheologist can perform a Reposition action in the Firefight phase after having repositioned as a Strategic Gambit, implying a need for rules on Strategic Gambits, Reposition action, and possibly the Firefight phase action restrictions. While 'STRATEGIC GAMBIT' and 'Reposition (1AP)' are mentioned, the full definitions of the Reposition action and the rules governing Strategic Gambits and their interaction with Firefight phase actions are not fully present. The 'Seeker of Divine Arcana' rule is mentioned but not fully defined. Therefore, the rules for 'REPOSITION (1AP)' and 'STRATEGIC GAMBIT' are missing but available in Core Rules and Approved Ops 2025 respectively.",
