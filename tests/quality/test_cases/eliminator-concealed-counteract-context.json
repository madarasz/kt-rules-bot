      "reasoning": "The retrieved context includes the ELIMINATOR SNIPER operative and the Silent weapon rule allowing shooting with Conceal order, but the ORDERS rule explicitly states that Conceal order prevents shooting and counteracting. The interaction between these rules is unclear without the full ORDERS rule definition. The ORDERS rule is present but truncated, so the full definition is available downstream. However, the question specifically asks if the Eliminator Sniper can shoot during counteract while having Conceal order, which involves the interaction of the Conceal order and counteract mechanics. The core mechanic 'COUNTERACT' rule definition is missing from the retrieved context, and it is essential to understand if counteracting with Conceal order is allowed or restricted. Therefore, the COUNTERACT rule definition is missing but available in Core Rules.",
