They can be placed underneath operatives (temporarily remove operatives to do so), and operatives can be placed upon them. Objective markers are 40mm in diameter. All other markers are 20mm in diameter. Some markers are known as mission markers. This means nothing on its own, but other rules interact with it.\n\nOperatives contest markers within their control range. Friendly operatives control a marker if the total APL of those contesting it is greater than that of enemy operatives, but control cannot change during an action. While an operative is carrying a marker (see Pick Up Marker action) it contests and controls that marker, and is the only operative that can.\n\n> **Designer's Note:** Objective markers are the most common marker, representing vital locations in the killzone. Controlling them is often required to achieve victory.\n\n> **Designer's Note:** It's fine to use a miniature to represent a marker, but have a normal marker available if it creates rules issues (e.g. it's too big).\n\n[Derived from illustration]\n**Marker Control Example:**\nIn the example shown, only three operatives contest the objective marker, as it isn't within control range of the orange operative on the left (the terrain feature prevents it from being visible).

Once during that activation, you can use one of the following rules:\n*   That operative doesn't require a marker to be within its **control range** to perform a mission action that usually requires this (this takes precedence over that action's conditions). Instead, the marker must be within 4\" of it and no enemy operatives can contest that marker. However, you can ignore enemy operatives within **control range** of other friendly **BATTLECLADE** operatives when determining this.\n*   That operative doesn't require a hatchway's access point to be within its **control range** to perform an **Operate Hatch** action. Instead, that access point must be within 4\" of it.",
