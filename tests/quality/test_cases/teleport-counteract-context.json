Only one operative can be on it at once, and whilst an operative is on it, that operative cannot touch the killzone floor (in other words, an operative can't be both on the teleport pad and on the killzone floor). Equipment terrain features cannot be set up **within 2\"** of a teleport pad. Whenever an operative's base is touching a teleport pad, if another operative is on that teleport pad, those operatives are treated as being within each other's control range.\n\nFrom the start of the **second turning point**, whenever a friendly operative on a teleport pad performs the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, you can teleport it. If you do, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up on the other teleport pad. It must still fulfil all other requirements of that action, otherwise it cannot teleport (e.g. if it's the **Charge** action, the operative must finish that action within control range of an enemy operative). If another operative is on the other teleport pad when an operative teleports, swap them around (if it's an enemy operative, its controlling player sets it up).\n\n[Derived from illustration]\n**Teleport Pad Exclusivity:**\nAn operative on a teleport pad has its base entirely on the pad and does not touch the killzone floor. This is a mutually exclusive state - the operative is either on the pad OR on the floor, never both.\n\n**Teleportation Requirements:**\nTeleportation is not free movement. The operative must still meet all action requirements (e.g., for Charge, ending within control range of an enemy). The teleportation replaces the movement portion but not the action's other conditions.\n\n**Teleportation Availability:**\nTeleportation only becomes available from the start of the second turning point onwards. During the first turning point, teleport pads function as normal terrain but cannot be used for teleportation.\n\n---",
