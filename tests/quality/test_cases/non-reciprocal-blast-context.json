        "text": "SHOOT (1AP)\nShoot involves selecting a ranged weapon and valid target not within friendly control range, rolling attack dice against the weapon's Hit stat with modifiers for obscured targets, rolling defense dice with cover saves, allocating defense successes to block attacks, and inflicting damage from unblocked successes, while prohibiting shooting with a Conceal order or within enemy control range.\n## SHOOT (1AP)\n\n▶ Shoot with the active operative by following the sequence below. The active operative's player is the attacker. The selected enemy operative's player is the defender.\n\n◆ An operative cannot perform this action while it has a Conceal order, or while within control range of an enemy operative.\n\n> **Designer's Note:** Unsurprisingly, Kill Team can be a very deadly game, so if you are frequently losing operatives to enemy shooting, consider playing more defensively with operatives in cover on a Conceal order.\n\n> **Designer's Note:** In some rare instances you will be the attacker and defender, such as when shooting a friendly operative as a result of the Blast weapon rule. When this happens, you roll attack and defence dice (not your opponent).\n\n> **Designer's Note:** Obscuring means it's less efficient to target an enemy operative through large intervening obstructions. However, this is ignored when operatives are at such obstructions – imagine them leaning around corners or through windows.\n\n### 1. Select Weapon\nThe attacker selects one ranged weapon to use that their operative has and collects their attack dice – a number of D6 equal to the weapon's Atk stat.\n\n### 2. Select Valid Target\nThe attacker selects an enemy operative that's a valid target and has no friendly operatives within its control range.\n\n* If the intended target has an Engage order, it's a valid target if it's visible to the active operative.\n\n* If the intended target has a Conceal order, it's a valid target if it's visible to the active operative and not in cover.\n\nAn operative is visible if the active operative can see it. An operative is in cover if there's intervening terrain within its control range. However, it cannot be in cover while within **2\"** of the active operative.\n\nAn operative cannot be in cover from and obscured by the same terrain feature. If it would be, the defender must select one of them (cover or obscured) for that sequence when their operative is selected as the valid target.\n\n### 3. Roll Attack Dice\nThe attacker rolls their attack dice. Each result that equals or beats the weapon's Hit stat is a success and is retained. Each result that doesn't is a fail and is discarded. Each result of 6 is always a critical success. Each other success is a normal success. Each result of 1 is always a fail.\n\nIf the target operative is obscured:\n* The attacker must discard one success of their choice instead of retaining it.\n* All the attacker's critical successes are retained as normal successes and cannot be changed to critical successes (this takes precedence over all other rules).\n\nAn operative is obscured if there's intervening Heavy terrain. However, it cannot be obscured by intervening Heavy terrain that's within **1\"** of either operative.\n\n### 4. Roll Defence Dice\nThe defender collects three defence dice. If the target operative is in cover, they can retain one normal success without rolling it – this is known as a cover save. They roll the remainder.\n\nEach result that equals or beats the target's Save stat is a success and is retained. Each result that doesn't is a fail and is discarded. Each result of 6 is always a critical success. Each other success is a normal success. Each result of 1 is always a fail.\n\n> **Designer's Note:** Remember, cover in this step usually applies to operatives with an Engage order, as a Conceal order would have prevented it from being a valid target in the first place.\n\n### 5. Resolve Defence Dice\nThe defender allocates all their successful defence dice to block successful attack dice.\n\n* A normal success can block a normal success.\n* Two normal successes can block a critical success.\n* A critical success can block a normal success or a critical success.\n\n### 6. Resolve Attack Dice\nAll successful unblocked attack dice inflict damage on the target operative.\n\n* A normal success inflicts damage equal to the weapon's Normal Dmg stat.\n* A critical success inflicts damage equal to the weapon's Critical Dmg stat.\n\nAny operatives that were incapacitated are removed after the active operative has finished the action.\n\n> **Designer's Note:** Some weapons shoot multiple times in one action, such as those with the Blast and Torrent weapon rules (see `weapon rules`). Therefore, operatives aren't removed until the whole action has been resolved.",
