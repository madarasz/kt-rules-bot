query: >
  My operative has a blast 2" weapon. Is it possible for it to be closer than 2"
  to its target, but not to be hit by the blast?
ground_truth_answers:
  - Yes, your operative with the blast weapon can avoid being hit by the blast.
  - Not being visible to the primary target allows your operative to avoid being hit by the blast.
  - Your operative is the shooter, the target within 2" is the primary target, and other operatives visible within 2" of the primary target are secondary targets.
ground_truth_contexts:
  # Blast rule
  - Secondary targets are other operatives visible to and within x of the primary target
