# KILLZONE: GALLOWDARK TERRAIN RULES

## KILLZONE SETUP

Killzone: Gallowdark uses a **606mm x 703mm** game board with a **6x7 grid** system for setting up. It has **4x** short walls with hatchway and pillars and **2x** each other terrain feature specified on page 109. It also has **8x** left and **8x** right pillars, and **30x** pillar caps to complete terrain configuration. Note that some mission maps use less than this.

---

## GALLOWDARK WALL

A Gallowdark wall terrain feature is **Heavy** and **Wall** terrain.
Some walls include a hatchway, which is explained separately on pg 69.

### Wall terrain:

* Operatives cannot move over or through Wall terrain (this takes precedence over all other rules).
* Visibility cannot be determined over or through Wall terrain.
* Other than to areas of the killzone (centre of the killzone, drop zones, etc.), distances cannot be measured over or through Wall terrain; they must be measured around it using the shortest possible route.
* For the purposes of cover and obscured, only the corners and ends of Wall terrain can intervene, unless the active operative has passed it.

[Derived from illustration - Page 2, Diagram 1]
**Distance Measurement Around Wall Terrain:**
When measuring distance between operatives separated by Wall terrain, the distance must be measured around the wall using the shortest possible route. Even if two operatives would normally be **within 3"** of each other in a straight line, Wall terrain forces the measurement to go around it, which can make the actual distance **more than 3"**.

[Derived from illustration - Page 2, Diagram 2]
**Cover Requirements for Wall Terrain:**
For an operative to be **in cover** from an enemy, a corner or end of the Wall terrain must be intervening. Minor protrusions or decorative elements of the wall do not count as corners or ends by themselves—it must be the main structure of the wall that creates a corner or end.

[Derived from illustration - Page 2, Diagram 3]
**Wall Corners and Cover:**
When a corner of a Wall is intervening between operatives, the operative behind that corner is **in cover**.

## HATCHWAY

A hatchway has two statuses: closed and open. It has two parts — an access point and a hatch — and their terrain types depend upon the hatchway's status. Operatives can perform the **Operate Hatch** mission action to change its status. Hatchways begin the battle closed.

### Closed
While a hatchway is closed:

* Its hatch must be fully shut.
* The access point and hatch are **Heavy** and **Wall** terrain.

### Open
While a hatchway is open:

* Its hatch must be fully open (it cannot be ajar).
* Its access point is **Accessible**, **Insignificant** and **Exposed** terrain.
* Its hatch is **Heavy** and **Wall** terrain, and the gap directly underneath it is **Blocking** terrain.

[Derived from illustration - Page 4]
**Hatchway Status and Terrain Properties:**
The terrain type of a hatchway's access point changes based on whether the hatchway is closed or open. When **closed**, both the access point and hatch are impassable **Heavy** and **Wall** terrain. When **open**, the access point becomes passable (**Accessible**, **Insignificant**, **Exposed**), while the hatch itself and the gap beneath it remain blocking.

> **Designer's Note:** As an open hatchway's access point is **Exposed** terrain, the walls either side of it must be used for cover and obscuring instead of the access point.

> **Designer's Note:** If operatives would prevent the hatch from fully opening or closing, temporarily remove them from the killzone, open or close the hatch, then return the operatives as close as possible to their original location. If an operative is within an enemy operative's control range before a hatch is opened, it must be returned there.

> **Designer's Note:** Opening a hatchway can cause the operative to be within control range of an enemy operative, in which case its **Dash** or **Reposition** action would immediately end (unless it has rules that allow it to move within control range of an enemy operative).

---

### OPERATE HATCH (1AP)

▶ Open or close a hatchway that's access point is within the operative's control range.

▶ An operative can perform this action during a **Dash** or **Reposition** action, and any remaining move distance can be used after it does so.

◆ An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, or if that hatchway is open and its access point is within an enemy operative's control range.

[Derived from illustration - Page 3, Diagram 1]
**Passing Corners and Intervention:**
When an operative has **passed the corner** of a wall (moved beyond it along their path), the wall is no longer intervening for cover purposes. The wall would only intervene and provide cover if the operative was on the side of the wall where the corner blocks line of sight.

[Derived from illustration - Page 3, Diagram 2]
**Wall Ends and Cover:**
When an **end of the wall** is intervening between operatives, the operative behind that end is **in cover**.

[Derived from illustration - Page 3, Diagram 3]
**Hatchway Status and Distance/Cover:**
When a hatchway is **open**, an end of the wall is intervening, making the distance **more than 1"** from both operatives, and therefore operative B is **obscured**.

## CLOSE QUARTERS RULES

Killzone: Gallowdark has the following additional rules.

### CONDENSED ENVIRONMENT

Weapons with the **Blast**, **Torrent** and **/or x" Devastating** (i.e. Devastating with a distance requirement) weapon rule also have the **Lethal 5+** weapon rule.

---

## ACTIONS

Operatives can perform the following universal actions.

### GUARD (1AP)

▶ The operative goes on guard until any of the following are true:
* It performs any action, moves or is set up.
* An enemy operative ends an action within its control range and you don't interrupt that activation.
* Its order is changed.
* It's the start of the next turning point.

◆ This action is treated as a **Shoot** action. An operative cannot perform this action while it has a **Conceal** order, or while it's within control range of an enemy operative.

> **Designer's Note:** Guard is a powerful action that allows an operative to attack later, at the opportune moment. It can change the dynamic of the game, so try to avoid enemy operatives on guard, or consider how best to utilise it yourself. Use the table above to indicated any operatives that are on guard.

> **Designer's Note:** Determine the target as normal in these situations. This means you don't have to target the operative you interrupted.

---

### On Guard

Once during each enemy operative's activation, after that enemy operative performs an action, you can interrupt that activation and select one friendly operative on guard to perform the **Fight** or **Shoot** action for free (including actions that are treated as such, e.g. **Hatchway Fight** opposite). If you do, that friendly operative cannot counteract during the turning point.

That friendly operative can even perform the **Shoot** action while within control range of an enemy operative (this takes precedence over the normal **Shoot** action conditions). This is known as a point-blank shot and has the following additional rules while your operative is doing it:

* Target the enemy operative within your operative's control range (even if it wouldn't normally be a valid target).
* Worsen the Hit stat of your operative's weapons by **1**.
* Until the end of the interrupted enemy operative's activation, your operative cannot retaliate.

---

## HATCHWAY FIGHT (1AP)

▶ Fight with the active operative.

▶ In the Select Enemy Operative step, instead select an enemy operative within **2"** of, and on the other side of, an open hatchway's access point the active operative is touching. For the duration of that action, those operatives are treated as being within each other's control range.

◆ This action is treated as a **Fight** action. An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, or if its base isn't touching an open hatchway's access point.

[Derived from illustration - Page 6]
**Hatchway Fight Mechanic:**
The **Hatchway Fight** action allows an operative to fight an enemy operative through an open hatchway without being in normal control range. The operatives must be on opposite sides of the hatchway's access point, with the active operative's base touching the access point and the enemy operative within **2"** of it. During this action, they are treated as being within each other's control range for combat purposes.

> **Designer's Note:** This action allows an operative to fight across an open hatchway – useful if the enemy is obstructing it and preventing your operatives from moving through.
