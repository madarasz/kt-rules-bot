# VOLKUS - Killzone Composition

Killzone: Volkus has **2x** strongholds, **2x** large ruins, **2x** small ruins, **2x** heavy rubble and **3x** light rubble.

---

## Stronghold

* The upper level(s) of a stronghold terrain feature is **Ceiling** and **Vantage** terrain.
* The door is **Accessible** and **Heavy** terrain.
* The fire steps are **Vantage**, **Insignificant** and **Exposed** terrain.
* The broken vent is **Blocking** terrain.
* All other parts of it are **Heavy** terrain.
* The three barrel containers on **Stronghold A** are **Blocking** and **Heavy** terrain.
* The small broken ramparts on the edge of the **Vantage** terrain of **Stronghold A** are **Insignificant** and **Exposed** terrain.
* The gap on the lower **Vantage** terrain of **Stronghold B** is **Accessible** terrain.
* For the purposes of control range, ignore the door and parts of this terrain feature less than **2"** high when determining visibility.
* You cannot have more than one friendly operative on the highest upper level of **Stronghold B** at once, and that
operative must be placed on one side or the other of that level, it cannot be placed in the middle (this means an enemy operative cannot be prevented from moving onto or being set up on the other side). If an operative’s base is too big to be placed there, it must move (or be set up) on as far as possible (otherwise it cannot complete that move), then place it to one side instead and treat it as being there. Hold it as far on that level as possible when it matters for checking other rules (e.g. control range, visibility, distance to other operatives, etc.). This takes precedence over the rules for bases and being in a location it can be placed.’

**Stronghold Terrain Structure:**
Stronghold terrain features are multi-level structures with distinct zones:
- Upper levels provide vantage positions for shooting
- Fire steps (elevated platforms) offer vantage points but leave operatives exposed
- Doors are passageways that can be traversed but block line of sight
- The broken vent creates a blocking obstruction
- When checking control range visibility through a stronghold, only consider parts of the terrain that are 2" or higher (ignoring doors and low walls)

## Large Ruin

* The upper level of a large ruin terrain feature is **Ceiling** and **Vantage** terrain. For the purposes of intervening and targeting lines, treat this level as the same height as the first upper level of a stronghold terrain feature.
* The upper rampart is **Light** terrain.
* The door is **Accessible** and **Heavy** terrain.
* The door's viewpoint is **Blocking** terrain.
* Unbroken windows are **Barred** and **Heavy** terrain.
  * **Barred terrain:** Visibility cannot be drawn through this terrain unless the operative or what they're trying to see is horizontally within **1"** of it.
* All other parts of it are **Heavy** terrain.

**Large Ruin Terrain Structure:**
Large ruins feature an upper level treated as equivalent height to a stronghold's first upper level for targeting and intervening purposes. Windows with intact bars restrict visibility unless an operative or their target is very close (within 1") to the window itself.

## Small Ruin

* This is **Heavy** terrain.

---

## Heavy Rubble

* This is **Heavy** terrain.

---

## Light Rubble

* This is **Light** terrain.

# CITYFIGHT

Killzone: Volkus has the following additional rules.

## Condensed Stronghold

Whenever an operative is shooting with a weapon that has the **Blast**, **Torrent** and/or **x" Devastating** (i.e. Devastating with a distance requirement) weapon rule, it also has the **Lethal 5+** weapon rule if the target is wholly within a stronghold terrain feature and on the killzone floor or a fire step.

> **Designer's Note:** *The Condensed Stronghold rule always relates to the target's location, so if the primary target is wholly within a stronghold, but the secondary target isn't, then this rule doesn't apply to that secondary target.*

## Garrisoned Stronghold

When an operative wholly within a stronghold terrain feature is retaliating against an operative that isn't, the defender resolves first (this takes precedence over the normal fight resolution order).

---

# ACTION

Operatives can perform the following universal action.

## Door Fight (1AP)

* Fight with the active operative.
* In the Select Enemy Operative step, instead select an enemy operative on the killzone floor and within **2"** of, and on the other side of, a door the active operative is touching. For the duration of that action, those operatives are treated as being within each other's control range.
* This action is treated as a **Fight** action. An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, or if its base isn't touching a door.

> **Designer's Note:** *This action allows an operative to fight through a door – useful if the enemy is obstructing a door and preventing your operatives from moving through.*
