[FAQ]
*Question*: There are secondary targets of a **Shoot** action as a result of the **Blast** weapon rule. The primary target had a **Conceal** order and was in cover from **Light** terrain, but was selected as a valid target as a result of the **Vantage** terrain rule so it received an improved cover save. Does each secondary target receive an improved cover save too?
*Answer*: Yes.

[FAQ]
*Question*: In Killzone: Volkus, if an operative is on the fire step of a stronghold, should the rest of the stronghold terrain feature be ignored for the purposes of determining if that operative or its target is obscured?
*Answer*: No.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Do changes to a weapon's Hit stat while shooting (e.g. **PATHFINDER** **Markerlights**) affect the D6 rolled for the **Hot** weapon rule?
*Answer*: Yes.

[FAQ]
*Question*: If a rule would prevent an action from being performed 'during that activation/counteraction' (e.g. **NEMESIS CLAW** **Chain Snares**), would it still prevent that action from being performed as a free action when it's not an activation or **counteraction** (e.g. as a result of a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** during the Strategy phase)?
*Answer*: Yes.

[FAQ]
*Question*: If an operative's wounds are reduced to 0, but it then performs a free action that allows it to regain lost wounds before it's removed from the killzone (e.g. **DEATH KORPS** **In Death, Atonement**, then **Medikit**), is that operative still **incapacitated** and removed from the killzone after that free action?
*Answer*: Yes.

[FAQ]
*Question*: In the Resolve Attack Dice step of the **Shoot** action, what order are successes resolved in? How does this interact with my rules that reduce or ignore damage from the first attack dice (e.g. **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** **Warding Shield**, **HERNKYN YAEGIR** **Tough Survivalists**)?
*Answer*: Successes resolve simultaneously. The defender can select one of the successes being resolved to reduce or ignore (as appropriate to their rule).

[FAQ]
*Question*: How does the **Guard** action interact with rules where the operative must perform the **Shoot** action with a specific weapon (e.g. **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM** **Astartes**, **KOMMANDO** **Dakka Dash**)?
*Answer*: The operative can perform the **Guard** action, so long as the relevant weapon is selected if it performs the **Shoot** action during the interrupt.

[FAQ]
*Question*: How does the **Guard** action work when the operative must spend an additional AP to perform two **Shoot** actions with the same weapon (e.g. **WARPCOVEN** **Astartes**)?
*Answer*: The operative can perform the **Guard** action for 1AP as normal, but if it performs the **Shoot** action during the interrupt, you cannot select the relevant weapon unless it had the AP remaining to do so during its activation.

[FAQ]
*Question*: If an operative's rules allow you to place a marker (e.g. **HERNKYN YAEGIR** **Hy-Pex Mines**, **VESPID STINGWING** **Neutron Bombardment**), then that operative is removed from the killzone, is that marker also removed?
*Answer*: No, unless specified otherwise.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Can something be wholly within a territory while also being on the centreline?
*Answer*: Yes, but it wouldn't be within the other territory.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Can you explain further what it means when a rule states that an operative is in cover and obscured if another target was (e.g. **Blast** X weapon rule, **BLOODED** **Dark Favour**).
*Answer*: When determining cover and obscured for that operative, whatever was determined for the primary or original target is the same. For example, in the case of **Blast**, secondary targets are not in cover/obscured if the primary target was not, and they are if the primary target was.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Do rules that prevent an operative from being selected as a valid target (e.g. **HERNKYN YAEGIR** **In Position**) prevent that operative from being a secondary target for a weapon with the **Blast** X weapon rule?
*Answer*: No, as secondary targets from **Blast** are not selected.

[FAQ]
*Question*: When counteracting, if a rule has increased or decreased the cost of an action, does this affect what actions an operative can perform? For example, can the **ANGEL OF DEATH** **Mobile Chapter Tactic** allow an operative to perform the **Fall Back** action while counteracting now it's 1AP?
*Answer*: Yes.

[FAQ]
*Question*: If a rule allows an operative to move 'any remaining move distance' from a previous action (e.g. **TEMPESTUS AQUILON PRECURSOR** **Dynamic**, **VOID-DANCER TROUPE** **Darting Salvo**) and its Move stat is changed between those actions (e.g. as a result of becoming injured), is the remaining move distance changed?
*Answer*: No.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Can operatives that can only perform a restricted set of actions (**WRECKA KREW BOMB SQUIG**, **ELUCIDIAN STARSTRIDER CANID**) perform actions that are treated as one of those actions, e.g. **Hatchway Fight**?
*Answer*: Yes, if that operative is permitted to perform the action it's treated as.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Can rules that ignore or reduce damage inflicted by an attack dice (e.g. **KOMMANDO**® **Just a Scratch**, **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** **Warding Shield**) ignore or reduce additional damage inflicted by that attack dice (e.g. **VESPID STINGWING**® **Vicious Venom**, **LEGIONARY** **Blood for the Blood God**)?
*Answer*: Yes.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Is damage from the **Devastating** X weapon rule considered to be additional damage inflicted by an attack dice, and can it be ignored by rules that ignore or reduce damage from an attack dice (e.g. **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** **Warding Shield**)
*Answer*: No to both.

[FAQ]
*Question*: If you automatically retain a dice as a success before rolling it (e.g. cover save, **Accurate** weapon rule), can that dice be re-rolled and does it have a numerical result?
*Answer*: No to both.

[FAQ]
*Question*: When retaining dice, if a rule retains a fail as a success instead, or a success as a critical success, does it change the numerical result of the dice?
*Answer*: No.

[FAQ]
*Question*: While shooting, fighting or retaliating, if I retain a dice as a normal success (e.g. **Accurate** 1), can I use another rule to retain it again as a critical success (e.g. **Rending**)?
*Answer*: No, a dice can only be retained once. Note, however, that some rules refer specifically to changing a retained dice (e.g. the **Severe** weapon rule) and that these allow a dice to be changed after being retained.

[FAQ]
*Question*: If I attempt to resolve a rule that allows a friendly operative to perform an action upon **incapacitation** (e.g. **BROOD BROTHER** **Broodmind Devotion**, **DEATH KORPS** **In Death, Atonement**) but that action cannot be completed (e.g. as a result of **HUNTER CLADE** **Scrapcode Overload**, **NOVITIATE** **Blinding Aura**), have I used any limited number of uses for that rule (e.g. once per turning point).
*Answer*: Yes.

[FAQ]
*Question*: When resolving rules that relate to an operative being activated, what order should these be resolved in?
*Answer*: Resolve rules that specify when an operative 'would' be activated first. Then resolve rules that specify when an operative 'is' activated, starting with rules that inflict damage (e.g. **PLAGUE MARINE** **Poison**).

[FAQ]
*Question*: When resolving rules that relate to an operative being **incapacitated**, what order should these be resolved in?
*Answer*: Resolve rules that specify when an operative 'would' be **incapacitated** first. Then resolve rules that specify when an operative 'is' **incapacitated** (including when an operative **incapacitates** another operative). This is followed by rules that specify 'before' an operative is removed from the killzone. Note that in the case of the **Medic!** rule and similar, this rule would resolve first, but would then prevent any relevant 'is' and 'before' rules being resolved (if any, as the operative would no longer be **incapacitated**).

[FAQ]
*Question*: If my operative is on **Vantage** terrain and shooting with a weapon with the **Seek Light** weapon rule against an operative in cover from **Light** terrain, can I elect to only use the **Seek** weapon rule, denying the improved cover saves from the **Vantage** terrain rule?
*Answer*: Yes.

[FAQ]
*Question*: In the third effect of **Vantage** terrain, for the purposes of obscured, what does '**Heavy** terrain connected to **Vantage** terrain' mean?
*Answer*: 'Connected' here refers to any part of the same terrain feature.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Does the additional movement cost to climb or move through **Accessible** terrain features count towards distance restrictions of rules (e.g. **PLAGUE MARINES** **Lumbering Death**)?
*Answer*: Yes.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Does the additional movement cost to move through **Accessible** terrain features count towards the maximum of 2" an operative can move during a **counteract**?
*Answer*: Yes. Note that this means operatives cannot normally move through **Accessible** terrain during a **counteraction**.

[FAQ]
*Question*: When does a player keep the initiative until?
*Answer*: Until the winner of the roll-off decides who has initiative in the next Initiative step. Note that this means the player that had initiative in the previous turning point would resolve the precedence of any simultaneous rules affecting the next Initiative step.

[FAQ]
*Question*: When a rule states 'in an order of your choice' (e.g. **SANCTIFIER CONFESSOR** **Lead the Procession**) is that referring to **Conceal/Engage** orders?
*Answer*: No. 'In an order of your choice' refers to the sequence in which the rule is resolved; in this example's case, the sequence in which the operatives move.

[FAQ]
*Question*: In the core rules it states 'You can never re-roll a dice roll more than once'. Can I use a rule to make my opponent re-roll a dice that's already been re-rolled (e.g. **HAND OF THE ARCHON SKYSPLINTER ASSASSIN** **Omen**, **WARPCOVEN SORCERER OF DESTINY** **Ravage Destiny**)?
*Answer*: No.
