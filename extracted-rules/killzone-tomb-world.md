# KILLZONE: TOMB WORLD - TERRAIN RULES

## KILLZONE SETUP

Killzone: Tomb World uses a **606mm x 703mm** game board with a **6x7** grid system for setting up. It has a sarcophagus, **4x debris** and **2x each** other terrain feature specified on the Killzone: Tomb World map key. It also has **16x half pillars** to complete terrain configuration. Note that some mission maps use less than this.

> **Designer's Note:** This killzone is similar to Killzone: Gallowdark from the Kill Team Core Book. To maintain consistency of rules – especially for those printed elsewhere – we've kept the terms the same. For example, even though Killzone: Tomb World uses portals rather than hatches, we still call it a hatchway and operatives perform the Operate Hatch action.

## TERRAIN RULES

### TOMB WORLD WALL

A Tomb World wall terrain feature is **Heavy** and **Wall terrain**. Some walls include a hatchway or a breach point (explained later).

**Wall terrain:**
* Operatives cannot move over or through Wall terrain (this takes precedence over all other rules).
* Visibility cannot be determined over or through Wall terrain.
* Other than to areas of the killzone (centre of the killzone, drop zones, etc.), distances cannot be measured over or through Wall terrain; they must be measured around it using the shortest possible route.
* For the purposes of cover and obscured, only the corners and ends of Wall terrain can intervene, unless the active operative has passed it.

[Derived from illustration]
**Wall Terrain Distance Measurement:**
When measuring distances between operatives separated by Wall terrain, the measurement cannot go through or over the wall. Instead, it must follow the shortest possible route around the wall. This can cause operatives who appear close in straight-line distance to actually be much farther apart when measured correctly.

**Wall Corners and Ends for Cover:**
Minor protrusions on walls do not count as corners or ends for the purpose of providing cover. Only the main structure of the wall turning a corner or ending qualifies. The corner or end must be part of the primary wall structure.

**Active Operative Passing Wall:**
When an active operative has passed beyond a corner or end of a wall (moved past a certain threshold line), that corner/end no longer intervenes for cover purposes. The threshold is determined by the operative's position relative to the wall's corner/end.

**Open Hatchway Cover and Obscured:**
When a hatchway is open, the ends of the wall sections on either side of the access point can intervene. If an end is more than **1"** from both operatives, the target operative is obscured. If an end is intervening but within **1"** of either operative, only cover applies (not obscured).

### HATCHWAY

A hatchway has two statuses: **closed** and **open**. It has two parts – an **access point** and a **hatch** – and their terrain types depend upon the hatchway's status. Operatives can perform the **Operate Hatch** mission action to change its status. Hatchways begin the battle closed.

#### Closed
While a hatchway is closed:
* Its hatch must be within its access point.
* The access point and hatch are **Heavy** and **Wall terrain**.

#### Open
While a hatchway is open:
* Its hatch must be removed from the killzone.
* Its access point is **Accessible** and **Insignificant terrain**.
* Its access point is also **Exposed terrain**. This means the walls either side of it must be used for cover and obscuring instead.

#### OPERATE HATCH **1AP**

**►** Open or close a hatchway thats access point is within the operative's control range.

**►** An operative can perform this action during the **Dash** or **Reposition** action, and any remaining move distance can be used after it does so.

**◆** An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, or if that hatchway is open and its access point is within an enemy operative's control range.

[Derived from illustration]
**Hatchway Status Change:**
The physical hatch piece is placed in or removed from the access point depending on the hatchway's status. When closed, both the access point and hatch block movement and visibility. When open, the hatch is removed entirely from the killzone, and the access point becomes passable terrain with the Exposed trait.

---

### BREACH POINT

A breach point has two statuses: **closed** and **open**. It has two parts – an **access point** and a **breach wall** – and their terrain types depend upon the breach point's status. Breach points begin the battle closed. To open a breach point, operatives can perform the **Breach** mission action (at which point it cannot be closed again).

#### Closed
While a breach point is closed:
* Its breach wall must be within its access point.
* The access point and breach wall are **Heavy** and **Wall terrain**.

#### Open
While a breach point is open:
* Its breach wall must be removed from the killzone.
* Its access point is **Accessible** and **Insignificant terrain**.
* Its access point is also **Exposed terrain**. This means the walls either side of it must be used for cover and obscuring instead.

#### BREACH **2AP**

**►** Open a closed breach point thats access point is within the operative's control range.

**►** An operative that has the word(s) 'breach marker', 'grenadier' or 'mine' on its datacard, or has a weapon with the **Piercing 2** or **Piercing Crits 2** weapon rule (excluding weapons that have the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule) can perform this action for **1 less AP** (to a minimum of **1AP**), but it cannot do so during an activation/counteraction in which it performed the **Charge** or **Shoot** action (or vice versa).

**►** Roll one D6 separately for each operative that's on the other side of the access point and has that access point within its control range: on a **4+**, subtract **1** from that operative's APL stat until the end of its next activation and inflict damage on it equal to the dice result halved (rounding up).

**◆** An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, or if that breach point is open.

> **Designer's Note:** The elite operatives that form kill teams are specially equipped to overcome all manner of barriers. Some draw upon esoteric traits and adaptable skills to inventively force a route to their target. From point-blank firepower and atomic destabilisers to bio-acids and raw strength fuelled by faith, operatives have a variety of methods at their disposal to breach weak points. The forces involved can result in extreme damage, with whizzing debris and violent shock waves hitting those unlucky enough to be on the other side.

[Derived from illustration]
**Breach Point Permanent Opening:**
Unlike hatchways, breach points cannot be closed once opened. The breach wall is permanently removed from the killzone when the Breach action succeeds.

**Breach Damage Mechanic:**
Operatives on the opposite side of a breach point being opened are subject to collateral damage. Each affected operative (within control range of the access point on the other side) rolls a D6. On a **4+**, they suffer two effects: APL reduction by **1** and damage equal to half the dice result rounded up (meaning **2** damage on a 4, **3** damage on a 5 or 6).

---

### TELEPORT PAD

A teleport pad is **Exposed**, **Insignificant** and **Vantage terrain**. Only one operative can be on it at once, and whilst an operative is on it, that operative cannot touch the killzone floor (in other words, an operative can't be both on the teleport pad and on the killzone floor).

From the start of the **second turning point**, whenever a friendly operative on a teleport pad performs the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, you can teleport it. If you do, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up on the other teleport pad. It must still fulfil all other requirements of that action, otherwise it cannot teleport (e.g. if it's the **Charge** action, the operative must finish that action within control range of an enemy operative). If another operative is on the other teleport pad when an operative teleports, swap them around (if it's an enemy operative, its controlling player sets it up).

[Derived from illustration]
**Teleport Pad Exclusivity:**
An operative on a teleport pad has its base entirely on the pad and does not touch the killzone floor. This is a mutually exclusive state - the operative is either on the pad OR on the floor, never both.

**Teleportation Requirements:**
Teleportation is not free movement. The operative must still meet all action requirements (e.g., for Charge, ending within control range of an enemy). The teleportation replaces the movement portion but not the action's other conditions.

**Teleportation Availability:**
Teleportation only becomes available from the start of the second turning point onwards. During the first turning point, teleport pads function as normal terrain but cannot be used for teleportation.

### SARCOPHAGUS AND DEBRIS (LIGHT TERRAIN)

[No specific rules text provided beyond identification as Light terrain]

---

## CLOSE QUARTERS: TOMB WORLD

Killzone: Tomb World has the following additional rules.

### ROOM

Each room is an area of the killzone that's entirely surrounded by Tomb World wall terrain features and, where necessary, killzone edges.

[Derived from illustration]
**Room Definition:**
A room is defined by its boundaries: Tomb World walls and/or the killzone edge must completely enclose the area with no gaps. Open hatchways and breach points do not break room boundaries (the wall sections defining them still count as boundaries). Rooms can vary significantly in size and shape.

---

### CONDENSED ENVIRONMENT

Weapons with the **Blast**, **Torrent** and /or **x" Devastating** (i.e. Devastating with a distance requirement) weapon rule also have the **Lethal 5+** weapon rule.

[Summary]
**Condensed Environment Impact:**
In the confined spaces of Killzone: Tomb World, area effect weapons (Blast, Torrent) and Devastating weapons with distance requirements become more lethal. They automatically gain the Lethal 5+ weapon rule, making them more likely to cause critical damage in close quarters.

---

### ACTIONS

Operatives can perform the following universal actions.

#### GUARD **1AP**

**►** The operative goes on guard (see right) until any of the following are true:
* It performs any action.
* An enemy operative ends an action within its control range and you don't interrupt that activation.
* Its order is changed.
* It's the start of the next turning point.

**◆** This action is treated as a **Shoot action**. An operative cannot perform this action while it has a **Conceal** order, or while it's within control range of an enemy operative.

##### On Guard

Once during each enemy operative's activation, after that enemy operative performs an action, you can interrupt that activation and select one friendly operative on guard to perform the **Shoot** or **Fight** action for free (including actions that are treated as such, e.g. **Hatchway Fight** below).

That friendly operative can even perform the **Shoot** action while within control range of an enemy operative (this takes precedence over the normal Shoot action conditions). This is known as a **point-blank shot** and has the following additional rules while your operative is doing it:

* Target the enemy operative within your operative's control range (even if it wouldn't normally be a valid target).
* Worsen the Hit stat of your operative's weapons by **1**.
* Until the end of the interrupted enemy operative's activation, your operative cannot retaliate.

[Summary]
**Guard Reactive Mechanic:**
Guard allows an operative to wait and react to enemy actions. The operative remains on guard until triggered by specific conditions. When an enemy operative ends an action within control range, you may choose to interrupt with a free Shoot or Fight action. The on-guard state is fragile and breaks if the operative performs any action, changes order, or fails to interrupt when given the opportunity.

**Point-Blank Shot Exception:**
A guarding operative can shoot while within enemy control range, overriding the normal prohibition. However, this comes at a cost: weapons' Hit stats are worsened by 1, and the shooting operative cannot retaliate until the enemy operative's activation ends. This represents the desperate, close-quarters nature of the shot.

---

#### HATCHWAY FIGHT **1AP**

**►** Fight with the active operative.

**►** In the Select Enemy Operative step, instead select an enemy operative within **2"** of, and on the other side of, the access point of an open hatchway/breach point the active operative is touching. For the duration of that action, those operatives are treated as being within each other's control range.

**◆** This action is treated as a **Fight action**. An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, or if its base isn't touching the access point of an open hatchway/breach point.

[Summary]
**Hatchway Fight Mechanics:**
This action allows operatives to engage in melee combat through open hatchways and breach points. The key requirements are: the active operative must be touching the access point, the target must be within **2"** of the access point on the opposite side, and no other enemy operative can be within control range of the active operative. During the Fight action, both operatives are treated as if within each other's control range despite the physical separation.
