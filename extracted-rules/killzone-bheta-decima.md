# KILLZONE: BHETA-DECIMA - TERRAIN RULES

## Killzone Configuration

Killzone: Bheta-Decima has **2x** short gantries, **4x** medium gantries, **2x** long gantries and **1x** thermometric condenser.

---

## GANTRY

* Gantry floors are Accessible and Vantage terrain.
* Gantry pillars are Heavy terrain.
* Gantry terrain features come in three sizes: long, medium and short. When they are connected (i.e. their gantry floors are touching each other), they are treated as the same terrain.

[Derived from illustration]
**Gantry Component Identification:**
A gantry structure consists of two distinct elements: the horizontal platform (gantry floor) which provides elevated positioning, and the vertical supports (gantry pillars) which hold it up. Each component has different terrain properties.

---

## THERMOMETRIC CONDENSER

* The roof is Accessible and Vantage terrain.
* The inner-ledge of the roof is Exposed and Insignificant terrain. In other words, ignore the slight difference in height between the outer and inner area of the roof.
* The battlements on the roof are Light terrain.
* All other parts of it are Heavy terrain.

[Derived from illustration]
**Thermometric Condenser Structure:**
The condenser features a large circular roof platform with raised decorative battlements at key positions. The roof edge includes a slight inner ledge that is mechanically ignored. The cylindrical body of the structure is solid Heavy terrain.

## HAZARDOUS AREAS

Killzone: Bheta-Decima has the following additional rules that use hazardous areas marked on the game board.

### RESTRICTED MOVEMENT

No part of an operative's base can be touching a hazardous area.

> **Designer's Note:** Lurking predators stop operatives from venturing too close to the ocean, while strong currents and toxic water prevent them from entering it.

[Summary]
**Movement Restriction:** Operatives are completely prohibited from entering hazardous areas. Even partial base contact is not allowed. This creates absolute no-go zones on the battlefield that must be navigated around.

---

### RESTRICTED TARGETING

When selecting a valid target for an operative on the killzone floor, an intended target on the killzone floor is not a valid target if **4"** of hazardous area is between them.

When selecting a valid target for an operative on Vantage terrain, an intended target on the killzone floor is not a valid target if the footprint of a gantry is between them. The same is also true in reverse (an operative on the killzone floor to an intended target on Vantage terrain). However, in both cases, ignore the footprint of gantry terrain features the operative or the intended target is on or in.

In both cases, use targeting lines to determine if a hazardous area or the footprint of a gantry is between them.

> **Designer's Note:** Relentless waves, sea mist and industrial smog make it harder for operatives to see targets over the ocean's surface.

> **Designer's Note:** Restricted targeting only matters if one or more of the operatives in question are on the killzone floor; if they are both on Vantage terrain, it has no effect.

**Gantry Footprint Definition:**
A gantry's footprint is the gantry itself, plus the area underneath it.

[Derived from illustration]
**Hazardous Area Measurement:**
When determining if **4"** of hazardous area blocks line of sight between two operatives on the killzone floor, measure the distance of hazardous terrain that the targeting line passes through. If this measurement equals or exceeds **4"**, the target is invalid.

[Derived from illustration]
**Gantry Footprint Blocking:**
When an operative on the killzone floor targets (or is targeted by) an operative on Vantage terrain, any gantry footprint intersecting the targeting line blocks the shot â€” except for the gantry that either operative is standing on or within.

[Summary]
**Targeting Restriction Principles:**
* **Floor-to-Floor:** Blocked only by **4"** of hazardous area
* **Floor-to-Vantage or Vantage-to-Floor:** Blocked by gantry footprints (except the one they are standing on)
* **Vantage-to-Vantage:** No restrictions from this rule
* Always use targeting lines to determine interference
* The operative's current position's gantry is always ignored for blocking calculations

---

## EQUIPMENT

Equipment can be set up on Vantage terrain and within **2"** of **Accessible** terrain (this takes precedence over setting it up on the killzone floor).

[Summary]
**Equipment Placement Priority:** When determining where to place equipment, Vantage terrain positions take priority over killzone floor positions. This overrides the standard placement rules for this killzone.
