# IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS COMPOSITION

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of 1 **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER SERGEANT-AT-ARMS** operative and 10 **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operatives selected from the following list:
- **ARMSMAN**
- **AXEJACK**
- **C.A.T. UNIT***
- **ENDURANT**
- **GHEISTSKULL***
- **GRENADIER**
- **GUNNER** with Navis las-volley and gun butt
- **GUNNER** with meltagun and gun butt
- **GUNNER** with plasma gun and gun butt
- **HATCHCUTTER**
- **SURVEYOR**
- **VOID-JAMMER**

The **SERGEANT-AT-ARMS** operative must be equipped with one of the following options:
- Navis shotgun and Navis hatchet
- Or one option from each of the following:
  - Bolt pistol or heirloom autopistol
  - Chainsword or power weapon

Other than **ARMSMAN** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. Your kill team can only include up to two **GUNNER** operatives.

Your kill team can only include a **GHEISTSKULL** operative if it also includes a **VOID-JAMMER** operative, and it can only include a **C.A.T. UNIT** operative if it also includes a **SURVEYOR** operative.

*These operatives count as half a selection each, meaning you can select both of them and it's treated as one selection in total.

# IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS FACTION RULES

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - VOID ARMOUR
The armour worn by Imperial Navy Armsmen is void-sealed, meaning that they can fight in environments devoid of gravity or atmosphere. Such armour also serves to protect them from explosive blasts and flaming torrents.

Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative, if the ranged weapon in that sequence has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule (excluding weapons that have a sweeping profile), you can re-roll one of your defence dice, or up to two of your defence dice if that friendly operative is a **GRENADIER**.

Friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operatives aren't affected by the x" **Devastating** x weapon rule (i.e. **Devastating** with a distance) unless they are the target during that sequence.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - BREACH AND CLEAR
Methodical, professional and well-drilled, Imperial Navy Breachers work as a unit to breach and clear the corridors and chambers of enemy voidcraft, space hulks, orbital stations and more.

Once per turning point, when a ready friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative is activated, you can use this rule. If you do, select one other ready friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative visible to and within 3" of that operative. When that first friendly operative is expended, you can activate that other friendly operative before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal.

You cannot do both, and you don't need to spend any CP to change the ploy.

# IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS STRATEGY PLOYS

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - ATTACK ORDER
Place your Attack Order marker in the killzone. Whenever a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative within 3" of that marker is shooting, fighting or retaliating, its weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule. In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, remove that marker. You cannot use this ploy and the Defence Order strategy ploy in the same Strategy phase.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - DEFENCE ORDER
Place your Defence Order marker in the killzone. Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative that's within 3" of that marker, you can re-roll any of your defence dice results of one result (e.g. results of 2). In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, remove that marker. You cannot use this ploy and the Attack Order strategy ploy in the same Strategy phase.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - CLOSE ASSAULT
Whenever a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative is fighting or shooting an operative within 3" of it, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Punishing** weapon rule.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - BRACE FOR COUNTERATTACK
Whenever an operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative that's within your territory or that hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action during this turning point, Normal and Critical Dmg of 3 or more inflicts 1 less damage on that friendly operative.

# IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - OVERWHELM TARGET
Use this firefight ploy when you use the Breach and Clear faction rule. Select one of those friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operatives. Until the end of that operative's activation, add 1 to its APL stat.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - BLITZ
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative performs the **Shoot** or **Fight** action, and you select an enemy operative within 6" of it as a valid target or to fight against. If it's the first friendly operative to perform either of those actions during this turning point, its weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule for that action. If it's the first friendly operative to be activated during this turning point, its weapons also have the **Severe** weapon rule for that action.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - LOCK IT DOWN
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative is activated. Select one objective marker. Until the end of the battle or until you use this ploy again (whichever comes first), when determining control of that objective marker, treat that friendly operative's APL stat as 1 higher. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - DECK HAND
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action if it has an APL stat of 1 or 2. That operative can move through one Accessible terrain feature without it counting as an additional 1" and/or perform a free **Operate Hatch** action during its activation, and can do so during the **Charge** or **Fall Back** action. You cannot use this ploy if the access point has been welded shut (see **HATCHCUTTER**) unless it's a friendly **HATCHCUTTER** operative's activation.

# IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS FACTION EQUIPMENT

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - REBREATHERS
You can ignore any changes to the APL stats of friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operatives, and they aren't affected by enemy operatives' **Shock** weapon rule.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - SLUGS
Up to three times per turning point, whenever a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a Navis shotgun (long range), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, improve the Hit stat of that weapon by 1 and add 1 to both of its Dmg stats.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - COMBAT STIMMS
You can ignore any changes to the Move stat of friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operatives from being injured.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - SYSTEM OVERRIDE DEVICE
Once per turning point, one friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative can perform the **Operate Hatch** action for 1 less AP.
