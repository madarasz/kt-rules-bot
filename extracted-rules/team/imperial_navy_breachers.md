## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - Faction Rule - VOID ARMOUR
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative, if the ranged weapon in that sequence has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule (excluding weapons that have a sweeping profile), you can re-roll one of your defence dice, or up to two of your defence dice if that friendly operative is a **GRENADIER**.

Friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operatives aren't affected by the x" **Devastating** x weapon rule (i.e. **Devastating** with a distance) unless they are the target during that sequence.

## IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - Faction Rule - BREACH AND CLEAR
Once per turning point, when a ready friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative is activated, you can use this rule. If you do, select one other ready friendly **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** operative visible to and within 3" of that operative. When that first friendly operative is expended, you can activate that other friendly operative before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal.

### IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHERS - Operatives - NAVIS SERGEANT-AT-ARMS - Command Breach
Whenever you would use the **Attack Order** or **Defence Order** strategy ploy, if this operative is in the killzone, it costs you 0CP. Once during each of this operative's activations, before or after it performs an action, if your Attack Order or Defence Order marker is in the killzone (see relevant strategy ploy), you can either:
*   Remove that marker and place it again.
*   Change the selected ploy to the other (e.g. your Attack Order becomes a Defence Order).
