# Brood Brothers

## Brood Brothers Composition

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of three fire teams selected from the following list:

*   1 **Brood Brother Commander** operative with one of the following options:
    *   Bolt pistol; chainsword and claw
    *   Drum-fed autogun; bayonet
    *   Laspistol; power weapon and claw
*   9 **Brood Brother** operatives selected from the following list:
    *   **Agitator**
    *   **Gunner** with flamer and bayonet. You cannot select more than three of these operatives combined.
    *   **Gunner** with grenade launcher and bayonet. You cannot select more than three of these operatives combined.
    *   **Gunner** with meltagun and bayonet. You cannot select more than three of these operatives combined.
    *   **Gunner** with plasma gun and bayonet. You cannot select more than three of these operatives combined.
    *   **Iconward**
    *   **Knife Fighter**
    *   **Medic**
    *   **Sapper**
    *   **Sniper**. You cannot select more than three of these operatives combined.
    *   **Trooper**
    *   **Veteran**
    *   **Vox-Operator**
*   3 **Brood Brother** operatives selected from the following list:
    *   2 **Psychic Familiar** operatives (still counts as one selection)
    *   **Magus** (counts as two selections). Your kill team can only include up to one **Broodcoven** operative. If one of these operatives is selected for deployment, your **Commander** operative loses the **Leader** keyword for the battle.
    *   **Patriarch** (counts as three selections). Your kill team can only include up to one **Broodcoven** operative. If one of these operatives is selected for deployment, your **Commander** operative loses the **Leader** keyword for the battle.
    *   **Primus** (counts as two selections). Your kill team can only include up to one **Broodcoven** operative. If one of these operatives is selected for deployment, your **Commander** operative loses the **Leader** keyword for the battle.
    *   **Trooper**

Other than **Trooper** operatives, your kill team can only include each option on this list once.

Up to three times, instead of selecting one of these operatives, you can select one **Brood Brother** ploy to cost you 0CP for the battle. Note that 'counts as' selections still apply; for example, if you select a **Patriarch** operative, you could not do this.

# Brood Brothers Faction Rules

## Brood Brothers - Crossfire
Whenever a friendly **Brood Brother** operative is shooting against or fighting against an enemy operative, after resolving all of your attack dice, if that enemy operative isn't incapacitated it gains one of your Crossfire tokens.

Whenever a friendly **Brood Brother** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an enemy operative that has any of your Crossfire tokens, you can remove any of those tokens. For each that you do, you can re-roll one of your attack dice.

**Abilities:**
- **Medic!:** The first time during each turning point that another friendly **Brood Brother** operative (excluding **Patriarch**) would be incapacitated while visible to and within 3" of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within control range of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn't incapacitated, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be incapacitated for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can then immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within this operative's control range. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Melee | Claws | 5 | 3+ | 5/6 | Relentless, Rending |

**Abilities:**
- **Alpha Predator:** Whenever an operative is shooting this operative, ignore the **Piercing** weapon rule. You can activate this operative twice during the turning point as long as it has AP to spend (it stays ready while it can still be activated a second time). Per turning point, it cannot move more than 9" and you cannot spend more than 4AP in total for it.
- **Monster:** This operative cannot use any weapons that aren't on its datacard, or perform unique actions (excluding **Into Shadow** and **Mind Control**). Whenever your opponent is selecting a valid target, if this operative has a **Conceal** order, it cannot use Light terrain for cover. While this can allow this operative to be targeted (assuming it's visible), it doesn't remove its cover save (if any).

**Unique Actions:**
- **Into Shadow [1AP]:** Change this operative's order. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.
- **Mind Control [2AP]:** **Psychic**. Select one enemy operative visible to and within 2" of this operative. Both players roll one D6 and add their respective operative's APL stat to their result.

You can only resolve this action's second effect once per battle. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, unless the only enemy operative it's within control range of is selected for this action.

This operative can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.

# Brood Brothers Strategy Ploys

## Brood Brothers - Pervasive
During each friendly **Brood Brother** operative's activation, you can ignore the first vertical distance of 2" they move during one climb up.

## Brood Brothers - Uprising
The first time each friendly **Brood Brother** operative performs either the **Shoot** or **Fight** action during each of its activations, if its order was changed from **Conceal** to **Engage** at the start of that activation, the enemy operative selected as the valid target or to fight against gains one of your Crossfire tokens as soon as it's selected (instead of after resolving your attack dice). This ploy has no effect if that friendly operative was activated within control range of an enemy operative. Note this ploy cannot come into effect more than once per activation (you cannot use it during both the **Shoot** and **Fight** action in the same activation).

## Brood Brothers - Embedded
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting a friendly **Brood Brother** operative, if you can retain any cover saves as a result of Heavy terrain, you can retain one additional cover save.

## Brood Brothers - Cult Devotion
Whenever a friendly **Brood Brother** operative (excluding **Patriarch**) is incapacitated while fighting or retaliating, if you have any unresolved attack dice, you can roll one D6: if the result is a success as if it were the Roll Attack Dice step of that sequence (i.e. using the same weapon, but with no re-rolls), you can strike the enemy operative in that sequence with one of your unresolved normal successes, or any of your successes instead if the D6 result is a critical success. In either case, that friendly operative is removed from the killzone afterwards.

# Brood Brothers Firefight Ploys

## Brood Brothers - Ruthless Coordination
Use this firefight ploy when selecting a valid target for a friendly **Brood Brother** operative. Until the end of the action, determine visibility as normal, but you can instead determine intervening (for cover and obscured) from another friendly **Brood Brother** operative that both that friendly operative and the potential valid target are visible to, but that isn't itself within control range of enemy operatives. Note the friendly operative doesn't gain the additional benefits of Vantage terrain if the other friendly operative is on it (e.g. to target an enemy operative that has a **Conceal** order that's in cover provided only by Light terrain).

## Brood Brothers - Unquestioning Loyalty
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Brood Brother Leader** operative is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **Brood Brother Broodguard** operative (excluding **Leader**) visible to and within 3" of that **Leader** operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being within the fighting operative's control range for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only in cover or obscured if the original target was. This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

## Brood Brothers - Idolisation
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Brood Brother** operative (excluding **Leader**) within 6" of a friendly **Brood Brother Leader** or **Brood Brother Iconward** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, in the Roll Attack Dice step. You can retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it, or retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## Brood Brothers - Insidious
Use this firefight ploy after an activation. Before the next activation, you can perform a free **Dash** action with one friendly **Brood Brother** operative, as long as it's not a valid target for enemy operatives when it starts and ends that action. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

# Brood Brothers Faction Equipment

## Brood Brothers - Cult Talisman
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **Brood Brother** operative (excluding **Patriarch**), in the Roll Defence Dice step, you can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## Brood Brothers - Covert Guises
After revealing this equipment option, roll one D3. As a **Strategic Gambit** in the first turning point, a number of friendly **Brood Brother Broodguard** operatives equal to the result that are wholly within your drop zone can immediately perform a free **Reposition** action, but must end that move wholly within 3" of your drop zone.

## Brood Brothers - Cult Knives
Friendly **Brood Brother Broodguard** operatives have the following melee weapon:
| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cult knife | 3 | 4+ | 3/4 |

## Brood Brothers - Lookout
**Strategic Gambit**. Select one enemy operative visible to a friendly **Brood Brother** operative to gain one of your Crossfire tokens.

# Brood Brothers Rules Commentaries
[FAQ]
*Question*: If my operative isn't injured at the start of the action and then is incapacitated, when rolling a D6 for the Cult Devotion strategy ploy, do I worsen the Hit stat of the weapon by 1 as a result of being injured?
*Answer*: No, as an operative's stats don't change during an action.
---
[FAQ]
*Question*: How does the Ruthless Coordination firefight ploy interact with an enemy operative that's wholly within an area of smoke, when the friendly operative that intervening is determined from is within 2" of that enemy operative?
*Answer*: Smoke Grenades and similar rules (e.g. **Mandrake Weave Darkness**) have no effect in this scenario.
