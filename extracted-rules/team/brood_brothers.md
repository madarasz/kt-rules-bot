## BROOD BROTHERS - Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of three fire teams selected from the following list:

*   1 **BROOD BROTHER COMMANDER** operative with one of the following options:
    *   Bolt pistol; chainsword & claw
    *   Drum-fed autogun; bayonet
    *   Laspistol; power weapon & claw
*   9 **BROOD BROTHER** operatives selected from the following list:
    *   **AGITATOR**
    *   **GUNNER** with flamer and bayonet (You cannot select more than three of the **GUNNER** or **SNIPER** operatives combined.)
    *   **GUNNER** with grenade launcher and bayonet (You cannot select more than three of the **GUNNER** or **SNIPER** operatives combined.)
    *   **GUNNER** with meltagun and bayonet (You cannot select more than three of the **GUNNER** or **SNIPER** operatives combined.)
    *   **GUNNER** with plasma gun and bayonet (You cannot select more than three of the **GUNNER** or **SNIPER** operatives combined.)
    *   **ICONWARD**
    *   **KNIFE FIGHTER**
    *   **MEDIC**
    *   **SAPPER**
    *   **SNIPER** (You cannot select more than three of the **GUNNER** or **SNIPER** operatives combined.)
    *   **TROOPER**
    *   **VETERAN**
    *   **VOX-OPERATOR**
*   3 **BROOD BROTHER** operatives selected from the following list:
    *   2 **PSYCHIC FAMILIAR** operatives (still counts as one selection)
    *   **MAGUS** (counts as two selections). Your kill team can only include up to one **BROODCOVEN** operative. If one of these operatives is selected for deployment, your **COMMANDER** operative loses the **LEADER** keyword for the battle.
    *   **PATRIARCH** (counts as three selections). Your kill team can only include up to one **BROODCOVEN** operative. If one of these operatives is selected for deployment, your **COMMANDER** operative loses the **LEADER** keyword for the battle.
    *   **PRIMUS** (counts as two selections). Your kill team can only include up to one **BROODCOVEN** operative. If one of these operatives is selected for deployment, your **COMMANDER** operative loses the **LEADER** keyword for the battle.
    *   **TROOPER**

Other than **TROOPER** operatives, your kill team can only include each option on this list once.

Up to three times, instead of selecting one of these operatives, you can select one **BROOD BROTHER** ploy to cost you 0CP for the battle. Note that 'counts as' selections still apply; for example, if you select a **PATRIARCH** operative, you could not do this.

Whenever a friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an enemy operative that has any of your Crossfire tokens, you can remove any of those tokens. For each that you do, you can re-roll one of your attack dice.

The first time during each turning point that another friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative (excluding **PATRIARCH**) would be **incapacitated** while **visible** to and **wholly within 3"** of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is **within control range** of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn't **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can then immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move **within this operative's control range**. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is **incapacitated**, or if it's a **Shoot** action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - BROOD BROTHER MEDIC - Medikit

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PATRIARCH - Alpha Predator
Whenever an operative is shooting this operative, ignore the **Piercing** weapon rule. You can activate this operative twice during the turning point as long as it has AP to spend (it stays ready while it can still be activated a second time). Per turning point, it cannot move more than 9" and you cannot spend more than 4AP in total for it.

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PATRIARCH - Monster
This operative cannot use any weapons that aren't on its datacard, or perform unique actions (excluding **Into Shadow** and **Mind Control**). Whenever your opponent is selecting a valid target, if this operative has a **Conceal** order, it cannot use Light terrain for cover. While this can allow this operative to be targeted (assuming it's **visible**), it doesn't remove its cover save (if any).

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PATRIARCH - Into Shadow
**1AP:** Change this operative's order. This operative cannot perform this action while **within control range** of an enemy operative.

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PATRIARCH - Mind Control
**2AP:** **PSYCHIC**. Select one enemy operative **visible** to and **wholly within 2"** of this operative. Both players roll one D6 and add their respective operative's APL stat to their result. If your total is higher than your opponent's, you can resolve this action's second effect. Until the end of the activation, that enemy operative is a friendly operative (an enemy operative for your opponent), you can change its order, and it can immediately perform one free action. It cannot perform an action in which it moves other than **Dash** (in which case specify the location for your opponent to move the operative to). You can only resolve this action's second effect once per battle. This operative cannot perform this action while **within control range** of an enemy operative, unless the only enemy operative it's **within control range** of is selected for this action.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PSYCHIC FAMILIAR

**Keywords:** BROOD BROTHER, TYRANID, GENESTEALER CULT, PSYCHIC FAMILIAR

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PSYCHIC FAMILIAR - Small
This operative cannot use any weapons that aren't on its datacard, or perform unique actions. Whenever this operative has a **Conceal** order and is **in cover**, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. Seek, Vantage terrain) except being **wholly within 2"**. This operative can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PSYCHIC FAMILIAR - Group Activation
Whenever this operative is expended, you must then activate one other ready friendly **BROOD BROTHER PSYCHIC FAMILIAR** operative (if able) before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal.

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PSYCHIC FAMILIAR - Elusive
This operative can perform mission actions while **within control range** of an enemy operative (this takes precedence over those actions' normal conditions). It can move through enemy operatives, move **within control range** of them, and during the **Charge** action can leave their **control range** (it must still end the move following all requirements for that move).

## BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PRIMUS
**Stats:**
- APL: 3
- Move 6"
- Save 4+

| Ranged | Scoped needle pistol (long range) | 4 | 3+ | 2/4 | Silent |
| Melee | Bonesword and toxin injector claw | 5 | 3+ | 4/5 | Lethal 5+, Rending |

**Keywords:** BROOD BROTHER, TYRANID, GENESTEALER CULT, BROODCOVEN, LEADER, PRIMUS

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PRIMUS - Fist of the Patriarch
This operative can either perform two **Shoot** or two **Fight** actions during its activation.

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PRIMUS - Mastermind
Once per turning point, after rolling off to determine initiative, if this operative is in the killzone, you can do one of the following (you cannot select each option more than once per battle):
*   Add 1 to your dice result.
*   If you didn't have initiative in the previous turning point, re-roll your dice.

### BROOD BROTHERS - Operatives - PRIMUS - Conspire
**1AP:** You gain 1CP. This operative cannot perform this action while **within control range** of an enemy operative, or more than once per turning point.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Strategy Ploy - PERVASIVE
During each friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative's activation, you can ignore the first vertical distance of 2" they move during one climb up.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Strategy Ploy - UPRISING
The first time each friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative performs either the **Shoot** or **Fight** action during each of its activations, if its order was changed from **Conceal** to **Engage** at the start of that activation, the enemy operative selected as the valid target or to fight against gains one of your Crossfire tokens as soon as it's selected (instead of after resolving your attack dice). This ploy has no effect if that friendly operative was activated **within control range** of an enemy operative. Note this ploy cannot come into effect more than once per activation (you cannot use it during both the **Shoot** and **Fight** action in the same activation).

## BROOD BROTHERS - Strategy Ploy - EMBEDDED
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting a friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative, if you can retain any cover saves as a result of **Heavy** terrain, you can retain one additional cover save.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Strategy Ploy - CULT DEVOTION
Whenever a friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative (excluding **PATRIARCH**) is **incapacitated** while fighting or retaliating, if you have any unresolved attack dice, you can roll one D6: if the result is a success as if it were the Roll Attack Dice step of that sequence (i.e. using the same weapon, but with no re-rolls), you can strike the enemy operative in that sequence with one of your unresolved normal successes, or any of your successes instead if the D6 result is a critical success. In either case, that friendly operative is removed from the killzone afterwards.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Firefight Ploy - RUTHLESS COORDINATION
Use this firefight ploy when selecting a valid target for a friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative. Until the end of the action, determine visibility as normal, but you can instead determine intervening (for cover and **obscured**) from another friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative that both that friendly operative and the potential valid target are **visible** to, but that isn't itself **within control range** of enemy operatives. Note the friendly operative doesn't gain the additional benefits of Vantage terrain if the other friendly operative is on it (e.g. to target an enemy operative that has a **Conceal** order that's **in cover** provided only by Light terrain).

## BROOD BROTHERS - Firefight Ploy - UNQUESTIONING LOYALTY
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **BROOD BROTHER LEADER** operative is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **BROOD BROTHER BROODGUARD** operative (excluding **LEADER**) **visible** to and **wholly within 3"** of that **LEADER** operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being **within the fighting operative's control range** for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only **in cover** or **obscured** if the original target was. This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Firefight Ploy - IDOLISATION
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative (excluding **LEADER**) **wholly within 6"** of a friendly **BROOD BROTHER LEADER** or **BROOD BROTHER ICONWARD** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, in the Roll Attack Dice step. You can retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it, or retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Firefight Ploy - INSIDIOUS
Use this firefight ploy after an activation. Before the next activation, you can perform a free **Dash** action with one friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative, as long as it's not a valid target for enemy operatives when it starts and ends that action. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Faction Equipment - CULT TALISMAN
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative (excluding **PATRIARCH**), in the Roll Defence Dice step, you can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Faction Equipment - COVERT GUISES
After revealing this equipment option, roll one D3. As a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in the first turning point, a number of friendly **BROOD BROTHER BROODGUARD** operatives equal to the result that are **wholly within** your drop zone can immediately perform a free **Reposition** action, but must end that move **wholly within 3"** of your drop zone.

## BROOD BROTHERS - Faction Equipment - CULT KNIVES
Friendly **BROOD BROTHER BROODGUARD** operatives have the following melee weapon:
**NAME:** Cult knife
**ATK:** 3, **HIT:** 4+, **DMG:** 3/4

## BROOD BROTHERS - Faction Equipment - LOOKOUT
**STRATEGIC GAMBIT**. Select one enemy operative **visible** to a friendly **BROOD BROTHER** operative to gain one of your Crossfire tokens.
