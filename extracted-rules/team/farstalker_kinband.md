## FARSTALKER KINBAND - Faction Rule - FARSTALKER
Farstalker Kindbands move and fight instinctively, reacting to developing battlefield conditions with an inhuman speed of thought.

In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, you can change the order of up to three friendly **FARSTALKER KINBAND** operatives that are not within **control range** of enemy operatives.

Whenever it's your turn to counteract, you can change the order of one friendly **FARSTALKER KINBAND** operative that's not within **control range** of enemy operatives instead. This still counts as you counteracting (so activation alternates back to your opponent afterwards), but doesn't count as that friendly operative's counteraction for this turning point.

## FARSTALKER KINBAND - Strategy Ploy - PREY
Whenever a friendly **FARSTALKER KINBAND** operative is shooting during an activation in which it hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, its ranged weapons have the **Balanced** and **Severe** weapon rules; if the weapon already has the **Balanced** weapon rule, it has the **Ceaseless** and **Severe** weapon rules instead.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **FARSTALKER KINBAND** operative is **incapacitated** by an enemy operative.
