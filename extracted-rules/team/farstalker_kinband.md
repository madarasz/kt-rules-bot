# Farstalker Kinband Faction Rules

## Farstalker
Farstalker Kinbands move and fight instinctively, reacting to developing battlefield conditions with an inhuman speed of thought.

In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, you can change the order of up to three friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operatives that are not within control range of enemy operatives.

Whenever it's your turn to counteract, you can change the order of one friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative that is not within control range of enemy operatives instead. This still counts as you counteracting (so activation alternates back to your opponent afterwards), but doesn't count as that friendly operative's counteraction for this turning point.

# Farstalker Kinband Strategy Ploys

## Farstalker Kinband - Cut Throats
Add 1 to the Atk stat of friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operatives' melee weapons (to a maximum of 5).

## Farstalker Kinband - Rogue
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative:
- Ignore the **Saturate** weapon rule.
- If you can retain any cover saves, you can resolve one additional cover save, or you can retain one cover save as a critical success instead. This isn't cumulative with improved cover saves from Vantage terrain.

## Farstalker Kinband - Prey
When a Kroot Farstalker has selected their target, the hunter's focus is directed fully towards bringing down their chosen prey.
Whenever a friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative is shooting during an activation in which it hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, its ranged weapons have the **Balanced** and **Severe** weapon rules; if the weapon already has the **Balanced** weapon rule, it has the **Ceaseless** and **Severe** weapon rules instead. Note that operative isn't restricted from performing those actions after shooting.

## Farstalker Kinband - Bound
During each friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative's activation, you can ignore the first vertical distance of 2" they move during one climb up.

# Farstalker Kinband Firefight Ploys

## Farstalker Kinband - Savage Ambush
Use this firefight ploy during the **Fight** action when a ready friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative that has Light or Heavy terrain within its control range is selected to fight against. In the Resolve Attack Dice step of that sequence, you resolve the first attack dice (i.e. defender instead of attacker).

## Farstalker Kinband - Slip Away
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action. During that activation, that operative can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.

## Farstalker Kinband - Poach
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative's activation. Until the end of that activation, that operative doesn't have to control a marker to perform the **Pick Up Marker** or mission actions that usually require this (this takes precedence over that action's conditions - it only needs to contest the marker).

## Farstalker Kinband - Vengeance for the Kinband
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative is incapacitated by an enemy operative. Until the end of the battle, whenever another friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against that enemy operative, that other friendly operative's weapons have the **Relentless** weapon rule. You cannot use this ploy again during the battle until that enemy operative is incapacitated.

# Farstalker Kinband Faction Equipment

## Farstalker Kinband - Piercing Shot
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a Kroot rifle, Kroot scattergun or dual Kroot pistols (focused), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Piercing 1** weapon rule. You cannot use the Piercing Shot and Toxin Shot rule during the same action.

## Farstalker Kinband - Toxin Shot
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a Kroot rifle, Kroot scattergun or dual Kroot pistols (focused), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Lethal 5+** and **Stun** weapon rules. You cannot use the Piercing Shot and Toxin Shot rule during the same action.

## Farstalker Kinband - Meat
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative (excluding **Hound**) is activated, if it's not within control range of enemy operatives, you can use this rule. If you do, that friendly operative regains D3+1 lost wounds.

## Farstalker Kinband - Trophy
Once per battle, during a friendly **Farstalker Kinband** operative's activation (excluding **Hound**), before or after it performs an action, if it's not within control range of enemy operatives, you can use this rule. If you do, add 1 to that friendly operative's APL stat until the end of its activation.
