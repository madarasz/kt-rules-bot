# MANDRAKES

## MANDRAKES COMPOSITION

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of 1 **MANDRAKE NIGHTFIEND** operative and 8 **MANDRAKE** operatives selected from the following list:
- ABYSSAL
- CHOOSER OF THE FLESH
- DIRGEMAW
- SHADEWEAVER
- WARRIOR

Other than **WARRIOR** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once.

### Archetypes
- INFILTRATION
- RECON

# MANDRAKES FACTION RULES

## MANDRAKES - SOULSTRIKE
Some weapons in this team's rules have the Soulstrike weapon rule below.

***Soulstrike:** Successful defence dice are determined differently. Each result that's equal to or less than the target's APL stat is a success and is retained. Each result that's higher than the target's APL stat is a fail and is discarded. Each result of 1 is always a critical success. Each other success is a normal success. Each result of 6 is always a fail.

*Designer's Note: Many of this kill team's rules refer to an enemy operative's APL stat. This would be the APL stat at the time the rule takes effect (i.e. including changes).*

## MANDRAKES - SHADOW PASSAGE
Once per turning point, one friendly **MANDRAKE** operative **WITHIN SHADOW** can use a **SHADOW PASSAGE** when it performs the **Reposition** action. If it does, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up **WITHIN SHADOW** in a location it can be placed. When you set it back up, it cannot:
- Be within control range of an enemy operative.
- Be a valid target for an enemy operative.
- Perform the **Shoot** or **Fight** action until the start of the next turning point.

## MANDRAKES - UMBRAL ENTITIES
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative, ignore the **Piercing** weapon rule. Whenever a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative is **WITHIN SHADOW**, improve its Save stat by 1.

## MANDRAKES - WITHIN SHADOW
An operative is **WITHIN SHADOW** if any of the following are true:
- It's within 1" of Heavy terrain that's not lower than it.
- Any part of its base is underneath Vantage terrain.
- A Shadow Portal marker is within its control range (see **SHADEWEAVER**).

**Abilities:**
- **Harrowing Whispers:** Whenever your opponent would activate an enemy operative within 6" of this operative, you can roll one D6 (you cannot do so if you also interrupted that operative's activation with the **DIRGEMAW** operative's **Haunting Focus** additional rule during this turning point): if the result is higher than that enemy operative's APL stat, they cannot activate it during this activation. If there are no other enemy operatives eligible to be activated, this rule has no effect.

## MANDRAKES - MANDRAKE DIRGEMAW
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 7"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 8

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ranged | Baleblast | 4 | 3+ | 3/4 | Soulstrike* |

| Melee | Glimmersteel blade | 4 | 3+ | 4/5 | Lethal 5+ |

**Abilities:**
- **Haunting Focus: STRATEGIC GAMBIT.** Select one enemy operative. Until the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, it gains your Haunting Focus token. The next time your opponent would activate an enemy operative that has your Haunting Focus token, if this operative is ready, you can activate this operative first (you cannot do so if you also rolled to prevent that operative's activation with the **NIGHTFIEND** operative's **Harrowing Whispers** additional rule during this turning point). If you do, during that activation, this operative must fight against or shoot against that enemy operative, and cannot do so against any other enemy operatives until it does (if this isn't possible, this operative's activation is cancelled). After completing this operative's activation, your opponent activates that enemy operative (if possible), or activates a different enemy operative if they can't.
- **PAREIDOLIC PROJECTION [1AP]:** Select one enemy operative that's a valid target for this operative or is **WITHIN SHADOW**. Until the start of this operative's next activation, until it's incapacitated or until it performs this action again (whichever comes first), worsen the Hit stat of that enemy operative's weapons by 1 and subtract 2" from its Move stat (these aren't cumulative with being injured); in addition, that enemy operative's APL stat cannot be added to (remove all positive APL stat changes it has). This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, unless the only enemy operative it's within control range of is selected for this action.

## MANDRAKES - MANDRAKE SHADEWEAVER
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 7"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 8

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ranged | Baleblast | 4 | 3+ | 3/4 | Soulstrike* |
| Melee | Glimmersteel blade | 4 | 3+ | 4/5 | Lethal 5+ |

**Abilities:**
- **Shadow Portal:** Whenever this operative performs the **Reposition** action using a **SHADOW PASSAGE**, you can use this rule. If you do, remove your Shadow Portal markers from the killzone (if any), then place one of your Shadow Portal markers within this operative's control range before it's removed and one within its control range after it's set up. Each friendly **MANDRAKE** operative can use a **SHADOW PASSAGE** each turning point (this takes precedence over one operative once per turning point) if one of your Shadow Portal markers is within that operative's control range when it's removed, and the other is when it's set up. Note that friendly operatives can do so even if this operative has been incapacitated, and doing so doesn't prevent one operative from using a **SHADOW PASSAGE** in the normal manner.
- **WEAVE DARKNESS [1AP]:** Remove your Weave Darkness marker from the killzone (if any). Then place your Weave Darkness marker visible to this operative, or on Vantage terrain of a terrain feature visible to this operative. That marker creates an area of smoke with the same size and effects of a smoke grenade, except you don't remove it during the following turning point. If this operative is incapacitated, remove your Weave Darkness marker from the killzone. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

# MANDRAKES STRATEGY PLOYS

## MANDRAKES - CREEPING HORROR
After each enemy operative's activation, before the next operative is activated, you can perform a free **Dash** action with one friendly **MANDRAKE** operative that has a Conceal order if it starts and ends that action **WITHIN SHADOW**. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point, and you cannot select each friendly operative for this ploy more than once per turning point.

## MANDRAKES - GLOAMING SHROUD
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative that's **WITHIN SHADOW**, you can retain one of your defence dice as a normal success without rolling it (in addition to a cover save, if any).

## MANDRAKES - BLADE IN THE DARK
Each friendly **MANDRAKE** operative can perform the **Charge** action while it has a Conceal order if it starts or ends that action **WITHIN SHADOW**.

## MANDRAKES - INESCAPABLE NIGHTMARE
Whenever a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, if it's **WITHIN SHADOW**, you can re-roll one of your attack dice.

# MANDRAKES FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## MANDRAKES - SLITHER OUT OF SIGHT
Use this firefight ploy at the end of any operative's activation. Select one friendly **MANDRAKE** operative that has an Engage order and is **WITHIN SHADOW**. Change that operative's order to Conceal.

## MANDRAKES - SOUL FEAST
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an enemy operative within 6" of it, at the end of the Resolve Attack Dice step. That friendly operative regains a number of lost wounds equal to that enemy operative's APL stat, multiplied by the number of your attack dice that inflicted damage during that sequence. Excess attack dice are ignored (i.e. if the enemy operative is incapacitated before remaining attack dice are resolved). You cannot use this ploy if that friendly **MANDRAKE** operative is incapacitated.

## MANDRAKES - NOWHERE TO HIDE
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative's activation, when it performs an action in which it moves. Until the end of that activation, that operative can move through parts of terrain features as if they weren't there, but must end those moves in a location it can be placed.

## MANDRAKES - SHADOW'S BITE
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative performs the **Fight** action during an activation in which it performed the **Charge** action, and selects a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative **WITHIN SHADOW** to fight against. In the Resolve Attack Dice step of that sequence, you resolve the first attack dice (i.e. defender instead of attacker).

# MANDRAKES FACTION EQUIPMENT

## MANDRAKES - CHAIN SNARE
Whenever an enemy operative would perform the **Fall Back** action while within control range of a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative, if no other enemy operatives are within that friendly operative's control range, you can use this rule. If you do, roll two D6, or one D6 if that enemy operative has a higher Wounds stat than that friendly operative. If any result is a 4+, that enemy operative cannot perform that action during that activation/counteraction (no AP are spent on it).

## MANDRAKES - SHADOW GLYPH
Once per turning point, when a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative is activated **WITHIN SHADOW**, you can use this rule. If you do, until the start of its next activation, while that operative has a Conceal order and is in cover, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. Seek, Vantage terrain) except being within 2".

## MANDRAKES - SOUL GEM
Once per turning point, when a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a baleblast, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Blast 1"** weapon rule.

## MANDRAKES - BONE DARTS
Once per turning point, a friendly **MANDRAKE** operative can use the following ranged weapon:
| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bone dart | 4 | 3+ | 2/4 | Range 6", Rending, Silent |

[FAQ]
*Question:* When a **MANDRAKE DIRGEMAW** is shooting with its horrifying scream ranged weapon and negatively changes the target's APL as a result of the **Stun** weapon rule, does that change affect defence dice rolled for the target during that same sequence in relation to the **Soulstrike** weapon rule?
*Answer:* No, as an operative's stats don't change during an action.
