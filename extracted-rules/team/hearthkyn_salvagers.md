# Hearthkyn Salvagers Faction Rules

## Grudge
If a particular foe shames or insults the Kin gravely enough, they will become the subject of a Grudge. To destroy that foe is paramount; the Kin will go to any lengths, even if it is to their own detriment.

Whenever an enemy operative incapacitates a friendly **Hearthkyn Salvager** operative, that enemy operative gains one of your Grudge tokens for the battle.

Whenever a friendly **Hearthkyn Salvager** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an enemy operative, for each of your Grudge tokens that enemy operative has, you can re-roll one of your attack dice or turn a normal success into a critical success instead. Note that Grudge tokens aren't removed when you do this.
