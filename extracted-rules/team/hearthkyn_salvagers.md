## HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Faction Rule - GRUDGE
If a particular foe shames or insults the Kin gravely enough, they will become the subject of a Grudge. To destroy this most hated enemy, the Kin will go to any lengths, even if it is to their own detriment.

Whenever an enemy operative incapacitates a friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operative, that enemy operative gains one of your Grudge tokens for the battle.

Whenever a friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an enemy operative, for each of your Grudge tokens that enemy operative has, you can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead. Note that Grudge tokens aren't removed when you do this.

**1AP:** Select one enemy operative within this operative's control range. You can move that enemy operative up to 3" to a location it can be placed. Then inflict D3+1 damage on it (even if you don't move it); if the D3 result is a 3, also subtract 1 from that enemy operative's APL stat until the end of its next activation. This operative can then immediately perform a free **Charge** action (even if it's already performed the **Charge** action during that activation), but cannot move more than 3" during that action.

If you do, that friendly operative isn't **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within this operative's **control range**. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends.

### HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Operatives - HEARTHKYN JUMP PACK WARRIOR - Jump Pack
Whenever this operative performs an action in which it moves, it can **FLY**. If it does, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up **wholly within** a distance equal to its Move stat (or 3" if it was a **Dash**) horizontally of its original location (in a killzone that uses the close quarters rules, e.g. Killzone: Gallowdark, this distance cannot be measured over or through **Wall** terrain, and that operative cannot be set up on the other side of an access point - in other words it cannot **FLY** through an open hatchway). Note that it gains no additional distance when performing the **Charge** action. It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it's the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within **control range** of an enemy operative.

### HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Operatives - HEARTHKYN WARRIOR - Secure Salvage
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against this operative, if this operative contests an objective marker or one of your mission markers, in the Resolve Attack Dice step, you can subtract 1 from the damage inflicted on it from one success.

## HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Strategy Ploy - NEED KEEPS
Select one objective marker or one of your mission markers.
*   Whenever determining control of that marker, treat the total APL stat of friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operatives that contest it as 1 higher if at least one friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operative contests that marker. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.
*   Whenever a friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operative is **wholly within 3"** of that marker, add 1 to the Atk stat of its melee weapons (to a maximum of 4).

## HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Strategy Ploy - TOIL EARNS

Whenever a friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operative is shooting an enemy operative **wholly within 6"** of it, improve the Hit stat of that friendly operative's ranged weapons by 1 (to a maximum of 3+).

## HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Firefight Ploy - THE ANCESTORS ARE WATCHING

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operative is **incapacitated**. It can perform a free mission action before it's removed from the killzone.

## HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Firefight Ploy - STURDY
Use this firefight ploy when an operative is shooting a friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operative, when you collect your defence dice. Change the attacker's retained critical successes to normal successes (any weapon rules they've already resolved aren't affected, e.g. **Piercing Crits**).

## HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Firefight Ploy - ENGAGE TO ACQUIRE
Use this firefight ploy after rolling your attack dice for a friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operative, if it's shooting against or fighting against an enemy operative that controls an objective marker or one of your mission markers. You can re-roll any of your attack dice.

Whenever a friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operative is climbing up, you can treat the vertical distance as 1" less (to a minimum of 2").

## HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Faction Equipment - EXCAVATION TOOLS
Friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operatives can perform the **Pick Up Marker** action for 1 less AP, and don't have to control the marker to do so (this takes precedence over that action's conditions - they only need to contest the marker).

## HEARTHKYN SALVAGERS - Faction Equipment - WRIT OF CLAIM
Once per battle, if friendly **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER** operatives contest two or more objective markers, after rolling off to decide initiative, you can use this rule. If you do, you can re-roll your dice.
