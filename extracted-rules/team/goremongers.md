# Goremongers Faction Rules

## Runes of Khorne
Each friendly **Goremonger** operative cannot lose more than 8 wounds per **Shoot** action.

## Gore Tanks
Each friendly **Goremonger** operative has a **Gore Tank** that has three levels: full, half and empty. They start the battle at half. Whenever a **Gore Tank** increases, it goes up one level; whenever it decreases, it goes down one level. A **Gore Tank** cannot increase when it's already full, or decrease when it's already empty.

- Whenever a friendly **Goremonger** operative incapacitates an operative within its control range, or visible to and within 2" of it, you can increase its **Gore Tank**.
- Whenever a friendly **Goremonger** operative uses a **Sanguavitae** rule, you must decrease its **Gore Tank**.

## Sanguavitae
Each **Sanguavitae** rule specifies when it can be used, and you must decrease the operative's **Gore Tank** to do so. You cannot use the same **Sanguavitae** rule more than once per activation or counteraction, and you cannot use more than two **Sanguavitae** rules per activation or counteraction. You cannot use **Mania** and **Fury** during the same activation.

- **Effect:** Until the start of that operative's next activation, add 1 to its APL stat.

### Sanguavitae - Fury
- **When:** During a friendly **Goremonger** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action.
- **Effect:** That operative can perform two **Fight** actions during that activation, and the second one is free.

### Sanguavitae - Rake
- **When:** When a friendly **Goremonger** operative performs the **Charge** action.
- **Effect:** When that operative finishes moving during that action, you can inflict D3 damage on one enemy operative within its control range.

### Sanguavitae - Surge
- **When:** When a friendly **Goremonger** operative performs the **Charge** or **Reposition** action.
- **Effect:** Until the end of that action, add 1" to that operative's Move stat.

X is your total number of successful unblocked attack dice, multiplied by 2. The target must be moved to a location it can be placed as close as possible to this operative, determined by the x" you choose to use. The move must be done in one or more straight-line increments, and increments are always rounded up to the nearest inch. Whenever the target is dropping during that move, ignore the vertical distance.
- **Prey:** Whenever this operative is shooting with this weapon, in the Resolve Attack Dice step, after resolving the **Drag** weapon rule (if you choose to), you can discard any of your successful unblocked attack dice.

# Goremongers Strategy Ploys

## Goremongers - Enhanced Violence
Whenever a friendly **Goremonger** operative's **Gore Tank** is:
- **Half,** its melee weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.
- **Full,** its melee weapons have the **Relentless** weapon rule.

## Goremongers - Augmented Endurance
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Goremonger** operative, if that friendly operative's **Gore Tank** is:
- **Half,** you can re-roll one of your defence dice.
- **Full,** you can re-roll any of your defence dice.

## Goremongers - Gory Tenacity
Whenever a friendly **Goremonger** operative is fighting or retaliating, the first time your opponent strikes it during that sequence, halve the damage inflicted (rounding up).

## Goremongers - Hunt For Blood
Select one friendly **Goremonger** operative. If it has a **Conceal** order, change it to **Engage**. Then it can immediately perform a free **Charge** action, but cannot move more than 3" during that action.

# Goremongers Firefight Ploys

## Goremongers - Unbridled Aggression
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Goremonger** operative is fighting during an activation in which it performed the **Charge** action, at the end of the Roll Attack Dice step. Until the end of that sequence, that operative's melee weapons have the **Severe** weapon rule.

## Goremongers - Gorethirst
Use this firefight ploy when you would counteract. You can do so with one friendly **Goremonger** operative that has a **Conceal** order, but you must change its order to **Engage** and it cannot perform any actions other than **Charge**, **Shoot** or **Fight** during that counteraction.

## Goremongers - Destructive Demise
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Goremonger** operative is incapacitated, before it's removed from the killzone. Inflict damage determined by that friendly operative's **Gore Tank** on one enemy operative within that friendly operative's control range. Inflict:
- D3 if empty.
- D3+1 if half.
- D3+2 if full.

## Goremongers - Lacerate Flesh
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Goremonger** operative with an empty **Gore Tank** is activated or counteracts. Increase that operative's **Gore Tank**. At the end of that activation/counteraction, decrease its **Gore Tank** (you cannot use this decrease to use a **Sanguavitae** rule); if you cannot decrease its **Gore Tank**, inflict D3 damage on it.

# Goremongers Faction Equipment

## Goremongers - Gory Totem
Before the battle, you can set up one of your Gory Totem markers wholly within your territory and more than 2" from other markers (excluding your Bloody Cadaver marker). Whenever an enemy operative within 3" of your Gory Totem marker is shooting, fighting or retaliating, your opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice.

## Goremongers - Bloody Cadaver
Before the battle, you can set up one of your Bloody Cadaver markers wholly within your territory and more than 2" from other markers (excluding your Gory Totem marker). Friendly **Goremonger** operatives can perform the **Pick Up Marker** action on that marker. In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, you can increase the **Gore Tank** of one friendly **Goremonger** operative that controls that marker, unless that friendly operative is within control range of an enemy operative.

## Goremongers - Chaos Sigil
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **Goremonger** operative, at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you can use this rule. If you do, worsen the x of the **Piercing** weapon rule by 1 (if any) until the end of that sequence. Note that **Piercing 1** would therefore be ignored.

## Goremongers - Wrist Chains
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Goremonger** operative performs the **Shoot** action and you're selecting a ranged weapon, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, the following melee weapons are treated as ranged weapons with the **Range 2"** weapon rule: chainblade, chainglaive, great chainaxe (ignore its **Brutal** weapon rule), pickrippers.
