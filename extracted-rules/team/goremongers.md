## GOREMONGERS - Faction Equipment - BLOODY CADAVER
Before the battle, you can set up one of your Bloody Cadaver markers **wholly within** your territory and more than 2" from other markers (excluding your Gory Totem marker). Friendly **GOREMONGER** operatives can perform the **Pick Up Marker** action on that marker.

## GOREMONGERS - Faction Equipment - CHAOS SIGIL
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **GOREMONGER** operative, at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you can use this rule.
