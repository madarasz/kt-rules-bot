# Wyrmblade Faction Rules

## Familiar Territory
When setting up a **Wyrmblade** kill team before the battle, one third of your kill team can be set up in **Hiding**: place them to one side instead of in the killzone. **Cult Agent** operatives cannot be set up in **Hiding**.

In the Firefight phase, friendly **Wyrmblade** operatives set up in **Hiding** are activated as normal. When you do, you can either expend that operative or have it emerge. If it emerges, set it up in the killzone in a location it can be placed as follows (it’s no longer set up in **Hiding**):
- Wholly within 6" of your drop zone.
- More than 6" from enemy operatives.
- With an order of your choice.

The operative is treated as performing the **Reposition** action (spend the AP accordingly), then continue its activation as normal. If the operative is a **Warrior**, ignore its **Group Activation** rule. Friendly operatives still in **Hiding** at the end of the second turning point are incapacitated.

## Cult Agent
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Wyrmblade Cult Agent** operative:
- Ignore the **Piercing** and **Saturate** weapon rules.
- If you can retain any cover saves, you can retain one additional cover save, or you can retain one cover save as a critical success instead. This isn’t cumulative with improved cover saves from Vantage terrain.

## Cult Ambush
Whenever a friendly **Wyrmblade** operative is shooting or fighting during its activation, if its order was changed from Conceal to Engage at the start of that activation, or it wasn’t visible to enemy operatives at the start of that activation, that friendly operative’s weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

**Abilities:**
- **Expert Swordsman:** This operative can perform two **Fight** actions during its activation. Whenever this operative ends the **Fight** action, if it's no longer within control range of enemy operatives, it can immediately perform a free **Charge** action (even if it's already performed the **Charge** action during that activation), but it cannot move more than 3" during that action. Doing so doesn't prevent it from performing the **Dash** action afterwards during that activation.
- **Quicksilver Strike:** Once per turning point, after an enemy operative performs an action in which it moves or is set up, you can interrupt that activation/counteraction to use this rule. If you do, this operative can immediately perform a free **Charge** action (you can change its order to do so), but it cannot move more than 3", and it must end that move within control range of that enemy operative. If this isn't possible, the interruption is cancelled and this rule hasn't been used.
- **Bladed Stance:** Whenever this operative is fighting or retaliating, you can resolve one of your successes before the normal order. If you do, that success must be used to block.

# Wyrmblade Strategy Ploys

## Wyrmblade - The Day is at Hand
Whenever a friendly **Wyrmblade** operative is activated, if its order is changed from Conceal to Engage, until the end of that activation:
- Its ranged weapons have the **Rending** weapon rule.
- Add 1 to the Atk stat of its melee weapons (to a maximum of 5).

## Wyrmblade - Crossfire
Whenever a friendly **Wyrmblade** operative is shooting an operative that another friendly **Wyrmblade** operative has already shot during this turning point, that first friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule.

## Wyrmblade - One with the Shadows
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Wyrmblade** operative that has a Conceal order, if Light terrain is intervening, that friendly operative is obscured (unless the intervening Light terrain is within 1" of either operative).

## Wyrmblade - Divert and Disappear
Up to three friendly **Wyrmblade** operatives can immediately perform a free **Dash** or **Charge** action in an order of your choice (choose separately for each, and for the latter, it cannot move more than 3"). If a **Wyrmblade Cult Agent** operative is selected for this ploy, it counts as two operatives, and it can perform a free **Fall Back** action instead (it cannot move more than 3"); if it does, subtract 1 from its APL stat until the end of its next activation.

# Wyrmblade Firefight Ploys

## Wyrmblade - Slink into Darkness
Use this firefight ploy at the end of a friendly **Wyrmblade** operative's activation. If that operative has an Engage order, change it to Conceal. You cannot use this ploy for each friendly operative more than once per battle.

## Wyrmblade - Coiled Serpent
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Wyrmblade** operative is shooting or fighting, after rolling your attack dice. If that friendly operative's order was changed from Conceal to Engage at the start of that activation and this is the first time it's performed either the **Shoot** or **Fight** action during that activation, you can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead. Note this ploy cannot come into effect more than once per activation (you cannot use it during both the **Shoot** and **Fight** action in the same activation).

## Wyrmblade - Unquestioning Loyalty
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Wyrmblade Cult Agent** or **Wyrmblade Leader** operative is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **Wyrmblade Neophyte** operative (excluding **Leader**) visible to and within 3" of that first friendly operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being within the fighting operative's control range for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only in cover or obscured if the original target was.

This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

## Wyrmblade - A Plan Generations in the Making
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Wyrmblade Neophyte** operative is incapacitated. It can perform a free mission action before it's removed from the killzone.

# Wyrmblade Faction Equipment

## Wyrmblade - Blasting Charges
Once per turning point, a friendly **Wyrmblade Neophyte** operative can use the following ranged weapon:

| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Blasting charge | 4 | 4+ | 3/5 | Range 4", Blast 1", Saturate |

## Wyrmblade - Cult Knives
Friendly **Wyrmblade Neophyte** operatives have the following melee weapon:

| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cult knife | 3 | 4+ | 3/4 |

## Wyrmblade - Explosive Traps
This equipment allows you to select two mines (see universal equipment). You cannot also select that equipment as normal (i.e. to give you three), and friendly **Wyrmblade** operatives are ignored for your mines' effects (i.e. they cannot trigger or take damage from them). This takes precedence over the normal mines rules.

## Wyrmblade - Spotlights
Whenever a friendly **Wyrmblade** operative is shooting, the target cannot be obscured if it's visible to and within 6" of a friendly **Wyrmblade Neophyte** operative that isn't within control range of enemy operatives.
