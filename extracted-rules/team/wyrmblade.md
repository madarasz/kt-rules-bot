## WYRMBLADE - Archetypes
- INFILTRATION
- SEEK & DESTROY

## WYRMBLADE - Faction Rule - FAMILIAR TERRITORY
When setting up a **WYRMBLADE** kill team before the battle, one third of your kill team can be set up in **HIDING**: place them to one side instead of in the killzone. **CULT AGENT** operatives cannot be set up in **HIDING**.

In the Firefight phase, friendly **WYRMBLADE** operatives set up in **HIDING** are activated as normal. When you do, you can either expend that operative or have it emerge. If it emerges, set it up in the killzone in a location it can be placed as follows (it's no longer set up in **HIDING**):
- **Wholly within** 6" of your drop zone.
- More than 6" from enemy operatives.
- With an order of your choice.

The operative is treated as performing the **Reposition** action (spend the AP accordingly), then continue its activation as normal. If the operative is a **WARRIOR**, ignore its **Group Activation** rule. Friendly operatives still in **HIDING** at the end of the second turning point are **incapacitated**.

## WYRMBLADE - Faction Rule - CULT AGENT
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **WYRMBLADE CULT AGENT** operative:
- Ignore the **Piercing** and **Saturate** weapon rules.
- If you can retain any cover saves, you can retain one additional cover save, or you can retain one cover save as a critical success instead. This isn't cumulative with improved cover saves from Vantage terrain.

## WYRMBLADE - Faction Rule - CULT AMBUSH
Whenever a friendly **WYRMBLADE** operative is shooting or fighting during its activation, if its order was changed from **Conceal** to **Engage** at the start of that activation, or it wasn't **visible** to enemy operatives at the start of that activation, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - LOCUS - Expert Swordsman
This operative can perform two **Fight** actions during its activation. Whenever this operative ends the **Fight** action, if it's no longer within **control range** of enemy operatives, it can immediately perform a free **Charge** action (even if it's already performed the **Charge** action during that activation), but it cannot move more than 3" during that action. Doing so doesn't prevent it from performing the **Dash** action afterwards during that activation.

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - LOCUS - Quicksilver Strike
Once per turning point, after an enemy operative performs an action in which it moves or is set up, you can interrupt that activation/counteraction to use this rule. If you do, this operative can immediately perform a free **Charge** action (you can change its order to do so), but it cannot move more than 3", and it must end that move within **control range** of that enemy operative. If this isn't possible, the interruption is cancelled and this rule hasn't been used.

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - LOCUS - Bladed Stance
Whenever this operative is fighting or retaliating, you can resolve one of your successes before the normal order. If you do, that success must be used to block.

**Keywords:** WYRMBLADE, TYRANID, GENESTEALER CULT, NEOPHYTE, HEAVY GUNNER

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - NEOPHYTE HEAVY GUNNER - Heavy Weapon Bipod
Whenever this operative is shooting with a weapon from its datacard, if it hasn't moved during the activation, or if it's a counteraction, that weapon has the **Ceaseless** weapon rule; if the weapon already has that weapon rule (i.e. from the **Cult Ambush** faction rule), it has the **Relentless** weapon rule. Note this operative isn't restricted from moving after shooting.

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - NEOPHYTE ICON BEARER - Icon Bearer
Whenever determining control of a marker, treat this operative's APL stat as 1 higher. Note this isn't a change to its APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

Once per turning point, when a ready friendly **WYRMBLADE NEOPHYTE** operative is **incapacitated** while **visible** to and **wholly within** 6" of this operative, you can use this rule. If you do, before that operative is removed from the killzone, it can either perform one free **Shoot** action (you can change its order to do so), or you can use the **A Plan Generations in the Making** firefight ploy for 0CP if that **incapacitated** operative is the specified friendly **WYRMBLADE NEOPHYTE** operative.

**Keywords:** WYRMBLADE, TYRANID, GENESTEALER CULT, CULT AGENT, SANCTUS, SNIPER

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - SANCTUS SNIPER - TARGET VULNERABILITY

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - SANCTUS SNIPER - FAMILIAR'S SOULSIGHT
**1AP:** Select one enemy operative **visible** to this operative. Until the end of the battle, or until this action is performed again by a friendly operative (whichever comes first), that enemy operative gains one of your Soulsight tokens. Whenever this operative is shooting an enemy operative that has one of your Soulsight tokens, all profiles of this operative's Sanctus sniper rifle have the **Saturate** weapon rule and that enemy operative cannot be **obscured**. This operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative.

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - SANCTUS TALON - Creeping Shadow
This operative can perform the **Charge** action while it has a **Conceal** order. Whenever this operative performs the **Fight** action, it can immediately perform a free **Dash** or **Fall Back** action afterwards (for the latter, it cannot move more than 3"), even if it's performed an action that prevents it from performing those actions.

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - SANCTUS TALON - ASSASSINATE
**2AP:** Select one enemy operative this operative isn't **visible** to. Perform a free **Charge** action with this operative, but don't exceed its Move stat (i.e. don't add 2"), and it must end that move within **control range** of that enemy operative. Then immediately perform a free **Fight** action with this operative against that enemy operative. The first time you strike during that action, you can immediately resolve another of your successes as a strike (before your opponent). This operative cannot perform this action while it has an **Engage** order, or while within **control range** of an enemy operative.

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - SANCTUS TALON - FAMILIAR'S SOULSIGHT
**1AP:** Select one enemy operative **visible** to this operative. Until the end of the battle, or until this action is performed again by a friendly operative (whichever comes first), that enemy operative gains one of your Soulsight tokens. Whenever this operative is fighting or retaliating against an enemy operative that has one of your Soulsight tokens, its Sanctus bio-dagger has the **Brutal** and **Balanced** weapon rules. This operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative.

## WYRMBLADE - Operatives - NEOPHYTE WARRIOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 7

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |

| ranged | Shotgun | 4 | 3+ | 3/3 | Range 6" |
| melee | Gun butt | 3 | 4+ | 2/3 | - |

**Keywords:** WYRMBLADE, TYRANID, GENESTEALER CULT, NEOPHYTE, WARRIOR

### WYRMBLADE - Operatives - NEOPHYTE WARRIOR - Group Activation
Whenever this operative is expended, you must then activate one other ready friendly **WYRMBLADE WARRIOR** operative (if able) before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal (in other words, you cannot activate more than two operatives in succession with this rule).

## WYRMBLADE - Strategy Ploy - THE DAY IS AT HAND
Whenever a friendly **WYRMBLADE** operative is activated, if its order is changed from **Conceal** to **Engage**, until the end of that activation:
- Its ranged weapons have the **Rending** weapon rule.
- Add 1 to the Atk stat of its melee weapons (to a maximum of 5).

## WYRMBLADE - Strategy Ploy - CROSSFIRE
Whenever a friendly **WYRMBLADE** operative is shooting an operative that another friendly **WYRMBLADE** operative has already shot during this turning point, that first friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule.

## WYRMBLADE - Strategy Ploy - ONE WITH THE SHADOWS
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **WYRMBLADE** operative that has a **Conceal** order, if **Light** terrain is intervening, that friendly operative is **obscured** (unless the intervening **Light** terrain is **wholly within** 1" of either operative).

## WYRMBLADE - Strategy Ploy - DIVERT AND DISAPPEAR
Up to three friendly **WYRMBLADE** operatives can immediately perform a free **Dash** or **Charge** action in an order of your choice (choose separately for each, and for the latter, it cannot move more than 3"). If a **WYRMBLADE CULT AGENT** operative is selected for this ploy, it counts as two operatives, and it can perform a free **Fall Back** action instead (it cannot move more than 3"); if it does, subtract 1 from its APL stat until the end of its next activation.

## WYRMBLADE - Firefight Ploy - SLINK INTO DARKNESS
Use this firefight ploy at the end of a friendly **WYRMBLADE** operative's activation. If that operative has an **Engage** order, change it to **Conceal**. You cannot use this ploy for each friendly operative more than once per battle.

## WYRMBLADE - Firefight Ploy - COILED SERPENT
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **WYRMBLADE** operative is shooting or fighting, after rolling your attack dice. If that friendly operative's order was changed from **Conceal** to **Engage** at the start of that activation and this is the first time it's performed either the **Shoot** or **Fight** action during that activation, you can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead. Note this ploy cannot come into effect more than once per activation (you cannot use it during both the **Shoot** and **Fight** action in the same activation).

## WYRMBLADE - Firefight Ploy - UNQUESTIONING LOYALTY
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **WYRMBLADE CULT AGENT** or **WYRMBLADE LEADER** operative is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **WYRMBLADE NEOPHYTE** operative (excluding **LEADER**) **visible** to and **wholly within** 3" of that first friendly operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being within the fighting operative's **control range** for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only **in cover** or **obscured** if the original target was.

This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

## WYRMBLADE - Firefight Ploy - A PLAN GENERATIONS IN THE MAKING
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **WYRMBLADE NEOPHYTE** operative is **incapacitated**. It can perform a free mission action before it's removed from the killzone.

## WYRMBLADE - Faction Equipment - BLASTING CHARGES
Once per turning point, a friendly **WYRMBLADE NEOPHYTE** operative can use the following ranged weapon:

| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Blasting charge | 4 | 4+ | 3/5 | Range 4", Blast 1", Saturate |

## WYRMBLADE - Faction Equipment - CULT KNIVES
Friendly **WYRMBLADE NEOPHYTE** operatives have the following melee weapon:

| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cult knife | 3 | 4+ | 3/4 |

## WYRMBLADE - Faction Equipment - EXPLOSIVE TRAPS
This equipment allows you to select two mines (see universal equipment). You cannot also select that equipment as normal (i.e. to give you three), and friendly **WYRMBLADE** operatives are ignored for your mines' effects (i.e. they cannot trigger or take damage from them). This takes precedence over the normal mines rules.

## WYRMBLADE - Faction Equipment - SPOTLIGHTS
Whenever a friendly **WYRMBLADE** operative is shooting, the target cannot be **obscured** if it's **visible** to and **wholly within** 6" of a friendly **WYRMBLADE NEOPHYTE** operative that isn't within **control range** of enemy operatives.
