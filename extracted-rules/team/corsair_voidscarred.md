## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Archetypes
- INFILTRATION
- RECON

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Faction Rule - RIFLES
Whilst not all Aeldari outcasts have walked the Path of the Warrior, all are skilled in the use of rifles.

Whenever a friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative is shooting with a shuriken rifle or ranger long rifle during an activation in which it hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, that weapon has the **Accurate 1** weapon rule. Note that operative isn't restricted from performing those actions after shooting.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Faction Rule - AELDARI RAIDERS
Aeldari are lithe, graceful and swift - qualities the Corsair Voidscarred utilise to outmanoeuvre their enemies.

Each friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative can perform a free **Dash** action during their activation.

### CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Operatives - VOIDSCARRED FELARCH - Veteran Raider
This operative can perform a 1AP action for free during their activation as a result of the **Aeldari Raiders** rule (instead of the **Dash** action).

### CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Operatives - VOIDSCARRED FELARCH - One Step Ahead
Once per battle, after an enemy operative performs an action during its activation, if this operative is ready, you can use this rule. If you do, roll one D6: if the result is higher than that enemy operative's APL stat, you can interrupt that activation and immediately perform either a free **Shoot** or a free **Fight** action with this operative, but you cannot select any other enemy operative as a valid target or to fight against during that action (note that secondary targets from the **Blast** weapon rule can still be targeted). After you perform that action, subtract 1 from this operative's APL stat until the end of its next activation.

### CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Operatives - VOIDSCARRED KURNITE HUNTER - Erudite Hunter

### CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Operatives - VOIDSCARRED SHADE RUNNER - Blink Pack
Whenever this operative performs the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, it can warp jump. If it does, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up **wholly within** 7" horizontally of its original location (in Killzone: Gallowdark, this distance can be measured through Wall terrain). It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it's the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within control range of an enemy operative. This operative cannot warp jump during the same activation in which it performed the **Dash** action (or vice versa).

### CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Operatives - VOIDSCARRED SHADE RUNNER - Slicing Attack
Whenever this operative performs the **Reposition** action with a warp jump (see other side of card), you can use this rule. If you do, after it moves, draw an imaginary line 1mm in diameter and up to 7" long between it and its previous location. Note this doesn't have to be a straight line. Inflict D3+2 damage on one enemy operative that line crosses. You cannot inflict damage on an enemy operative that was not **visible** to this operative at the start of that action. A 28mm round marker can be temporarily placed underneath this operative before it moves to help determine this.

### CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Operatives - VOIDSCARRED STARSTORM DUELLIST - Pistol Barrage
**1AP:** Perform two free **Shoot** actions with this operative (this takes precedence over action restrictions).

### CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Operatives - VOIDSCARRED WAY SEEKER - Warp Fold
**1AP:** **PSYCHIC.** Select two friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operatives **visible** to and **wholly within** 5" of this operative. Remove them both from the killzone and set them back up in each other's previous locations (in other words, swap their positions). If one of them performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action during this turning point and the other is ready, the other cannot perform any of those actions in its activation during this turning point. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

### CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Operatives - VOIDSCARRED WAY SEEKER - Warding Shield
**1AP:** **PSYCHIC.** Select one friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative **visible** to and **wholly within** 6" of this operative. Until the start of this operative's next activation, until it's **incapacitated** or until it performs this action again (whichever comes first), the first time an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on that friendly operative, ignore that inflicted damage. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Strategy Ploy - PLUNDERERS
Up to D3 friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operatives can immediately perform a free **Dash** action in an order of your choice. This turning point, each that does so cannot perform the **Dash** action during their activation. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Strategy Ploy - PIRATICAL PROFITEERS
Whenever a friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, if it or the enemy operative in that sequence contests an objective marker or one of your mission markers, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Strategy Ploy - MOBILE ENGAGEMENT
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative that performed an action in which it moved during this turning point, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Strategy Ploy - OUTCASTS
Whenever a friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative is more than 5" from other friendly operatives, its weapons have the **Punishing** weapon rule.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Firefight Ploy - OPPORTUNISTIC FIGHTERS
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative performs the **Fall Back** action. Before it moves, inflict 2D3 damage on that operative for each friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative within its control range.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Firefight Ploy - LIGHT FINGERS
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative's activation. Until the end of that activation, having an enemy operative within its control range doesn't prevent that friendly operative from performing the **Pick Up Marker** or mission actions.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Firefight Ploy - CAPRICIOUS FLIGHT
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action. During that activation, that operative can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Firefight Ploy - CONTEMPTUOUS ADVENTURER
Use this firefight ploy when the first friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative is activated during the turning point, if it's more than 5" from other friendly operatives. The first time that operative performs either the **Shoot** or **Fight** action during that activation, its weapons have the **Relentless** weapon rule. Note this ploy cannot come into effect more than once per activation (you cannot use it during both the **Shoot** and **Fight** action in the same activation).

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Faction Equipment - DIUTURNAL MANTLES
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative, if the ranged weapon in that sequence has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule, you can re-roll one of your defence dice. In addition, friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operatives aren't affected by the **x" Devastating x** weapon rule (i.e. **Devastating** with a distance) unless they are the target during that sequence.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Faction Equipment - MISTFIELD
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED** operative more than 3" from it, at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you can use this rule. If you do, worsen the x of the **Piercing** weapon rule by 1 (if any) until the end of that sequence. Note that **Piercing 1** would therefore be ignored.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Faction Equipment - RUNES OF GUIDANCE
Once per turning point, when a friendly **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED WAY SEEKER** or **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED SOUL WEAVER** operative is performing a **PSYCHIC** unique action (excluding **Warp Fold**), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, add 3" to its distance requirement. Note this has no effect on **PSYCHIC** weapons (e.g. the **Devastating** distance requirement of lightning strike).

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Faction Equipment - STAR CHARTS
**STRATEGIC GAMBIT.** Roll one D3: if the result is higher than the number of the current turning point, you gain 1CP and cannot use this **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** for the rest of the battle.

## CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED - Rules Commentaries
[FAQ]
*Question*: If a **STARSTORM DUELLIST** is on guard and I interrupt an activation to perform a **Shoot** action against an enemy operative within its control range, can I use its Quick on the Trigger rule to perform the **Shoot** action normally, or must it be a point-blank shot?
*Answer*: The former - you can perform the **Shoot** action normally.
