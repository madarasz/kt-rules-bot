# Corsair Voidscarred Faction Rules

## Corsair Voidscarred - Rifles
Whenever a friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative is shooting with a shuriken rifle or ranger long rifle during an activation in which it hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, that weapon has the **Accurate 1** weapon rule. Note that operative isn't restricted from performing those actions after shooting.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Aeldari Raiders
Each friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative can perform a free **Dash** action during their activation.

- **One Step Ahead:** Once per battle, after an enemy operative performs an action during its activation, if this operative is ready, you can use this rule. If you do, roll one D6: if the result is higher than that enemy operative's APL stat, you can interrupt that activation and immediately perform either a free **Shoot** or a free **Fight** action with this operative, but you cannot select any other enemy operative as a valid target or to fight against during that action (note that secondary targets from the **Blast** weapon rule can still be targeted). After you perform that action, subtract 1 from this operative's APL stat until the end of its next activation.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Voidscarred Kurnite Hunter
**Stats:**
- APL: 2

- Save: 4+
- Wounds: 8

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|------|------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
| Ranged | Faolchú | 4 | 3+ | 1/2 | Rending, Saturate, Seek Light, Silent |
| Ranged | Shuriken pistol | 4 | 3+ | 3/4 | Range 8", Rending |

**Abilities:**
- **Faolchú's Bond:** The first time during each turning point that this operative is retaliating, if it's ready it hasn't used its Faolchú ranged weapon during this turning point, in the Resolve Attack Dice step of that sequence, you resolve the first attack dice (i.e. defender instead of attacker).
- **Erudite Hunter:** Strategic Gambit. Select one enemy operative within 9" of this operative. Once during this turning point, after that enemy operative performs an action in which it moves during its activation, you can interrupt that activation to use this rule. If you do, this operative can immediately perform either a free **Reposition** action (it cannot end that move further from that enemy operative), or a free **Charge** action (you can change its order to do so, and it must end that move within control range of that enemy operative).

## Corsair Voidscarred - Voidscarred Shade Runner
**Stats:**

| Ranged | Throwing blades | 4 | 3+ | 2/4 | Range 6", Silent |
| Melee | Hekatarii blades | 4 | 3+ | 3/5 | Ceaseless, Lethal 5+ |

**Abilities:**
- **Blink Pack:** Whenever this operative performs the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, it can warp jump. If it does, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up wholly within 7" horizontally of its original location (in Killzone: Gallowdark, this distance can be measured through Wall terrain). It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it's the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within control range of an enemy operative. This operative cannot warp jump during the same activation in which it performed the **Dash** action (or vice versa).
- **Slicing Attack:** Whenever this operative performs the **Reposition** action with a warp jump, you can use this rule. If you do, after it moves, draw an imaginary line 1mm in diameter and up to 7" long between it and its previous location. Note this doesn't have to be a straight line. Inflict D3+2 damage on one enemy operative that line crosses. You cannot inflict damage on an enemy operative that was not visible to this operative at the start of that action. A 28mm round marker can be temporarily placed underneath this operative before it moves to help determine this.

# Corsair Voidscarred Strategy Ploys

## Corsair Voidscarred - Plunderers
Up to D3 friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operatives can immediately perform a free **Dash** action in an order of your choice. This turning point, each that does so cannot perform the **Dash** action during their activation. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Piratical Profiteers
Whenever a friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, if it or the enemy operative in that sequence contests an objective marker or one of your mission markers, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Mobile Engagement
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative that performed an action in which it moved during this turning point, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Outcasts
Whenever a friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative is more than 5" from other friendly operatives, its weapons have the **Punishing** weapon rule.

# Corsair Voidscarred Firefight Ploys

## Corsair Voidscarred - Opportunistic Fighters
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative performs the **Fall Back** action. Before it moves, inflict 2D3 damage on that operative for each friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative within its control range.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Light Fingers
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative's activation. Until the end of that activation, having an enemy operative within its control range doesn't prevent that friendly operative from performing the **Pick Up Marker** or mission actions.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Capricious Flight
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action. During that activation, that operative can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Contemptuous Adventurer
Use this firefight ploy when the first friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative is activated during the turning point, if it's more than 5" from other friendly operatives. The first time that operative performs either the **Shoot** or **Fight** action during that activation, its weapons have the **Relentless** weapon rule. Note this ploy cannot come into effect more than once per activation (you cannot use it during both the **Shoot** and **Fight** action in the same activation).

# Corsair Voidscarred Faction Equipment

## Corsair Voidscarred - Diuturnal Mantles
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative, if the ranged weapon in that sequence has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule, you can re-roll one of your defence dice. In addition, friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operatives aren't affected by the x" **Devastating** x weapon rule (i.e. **Devastating** with a distance) unless they are the target during that sequence.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Mistfield
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **Corsair Voidscarred** operative more than 3" from it, at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you can use this rule. If you do, worsen the x of the **Piercing** weapon rule by 1 (if any) until the end of that sequence. Note that **Piercing 1** would therefore be ignored.

## Corsair Voidscarred - Runes of Guidance
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Corsair Voidscarred Way Seeker** or **Corsair Voidscarred Soul Weaver** operative is performing a **Psychic** unique action (excluding **Warp Fold**), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, add 3" to its distance requirement. Note this has no effect on **Psychic** weapons (e.g. the **Devastating** distance requirement of lightning strike).

## Corsair Voidscarred - Star Charts
**Strategic Gambit**. Roll one D3: if the result is higher than the number of the current turning point, you gain 1CP and cannot use this **Strategic Gambit** for the rest of the battle.

# Corsair Voidscarred Rules Commentaries
[FAQ]
*Question*: If a **Starstorm Duellist** is on guard and I interrupt an activation to perform a **Shoot** action against an enemy operative within its control range, can I use its Quick on the Trigger rule to perform the **Shoot** action normally, or must it be a point-blank shot?
*Answer*: The former - you can perform the **Shoot** action normally.
