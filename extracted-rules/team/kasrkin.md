# Kasrkin

## Kasrkin Composition

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of 1 **Kasrkin Sergeant** operative and 9 other **Kasrkin** operatives selected from the following list:
- **Combat Medic**
- **Demo-Trooper**
- **Gunner** with flamer and gun butt
- **Gunner** with grenade launcher and gun butt
- **Gunner** with hot-shot volley gun and gun butt
- **Gunner** with meltagun and gun butt
- **Gunner** with plasma gun and gun butt
- **Recon-Trooper**

Other than **Trooper** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. You cannot select more than four of the following operatives combined: **Gunner**, **Sharpshooter**.

Some **Kasrkin** rules refer to a 'hot-shot weapon'. This is a ranged weapon that includes 'hot-shot' in its name, e.g. hot-shot lasgun, all profiles of a hot-shot marksman rifle, etc.

### Archetypes
- Security, Seek & Destroy

# Kasrkin Faction Rules

## Kasrkin - Skill At Arms
The Kasrkin go where they are needed. Battle-hardened, uncompromising and equipped with the best weapons available, these elites pursue their objectives with professionalism, hard-won experience and rigid determination.

**Strategic Gambit:** Select a Skill At Arms for friendly **Kasrkin** operatives to have until the Ready step of the next Strategy phase.

### Light 'Em Up
Whenever a friendly **Kasrkin** operative is shooting, its ranged weapons have the **Severe** weapon rule if any of the following are true for the target:
- It's ready.
- It's not in cover.
- It's being scanned (see **Recon-Trooper**).

### Strike Fast
Whenever a friendly **Kasrkin** operative is performing the **Reposition** action, add 1" to its Move stat.

### Ice In Your Veins
Whenever a friendly **Kasrkin** operative is fighting or retaliating, or an operative is shooting it, the first time an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg of 3 or more on this operative during that sequence, that dice inflicts 1 less damage on it.

### For Cadia!
Add 1 to the Atk stat of friendly **Kasrkin** operatives' melee weapons (to a maximum of 4). Whenever a friendly **Kasrkin** operative is fighting, the first time you strike during that sequence, inflict 1 additional damage.

**Abilities:**
- **Medic!:** The first time during each turning point that another friendly **Kasrkin** operative would be **incapacitated** while visible to and within 3" of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within control range of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn't **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can then immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within this operative's control range. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is **incapacitated**, or if it's a **Shoot** action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.
- **Medikit [0AP]:** Select one friendly **Kasrkin** operative within this operative's control range to regain up to 2D3 lost wounds. It cannot be an operative that the Medic! rule was used on during this turning point. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

# Kasrkin Strategy Ploys

## Kasrkin - Elimination Pattern
Whenever a friendly **Kasrkin** operative is shooting with a hot-shot weapon against an operative that's not in cover or is being scanned (see **Recon-Trooper**), that weapon has the **Piercing Crits 1** weapon rule, or **Piercing 1** instead if it's a hot-shot volley gun.

## Kasrkin - Engage From Cover
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Kasrkin** operative that's in cover, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## Kasrkin - Clearance Sweep
Place your Clearance Sweep marker in the killzone. Whenever a friendly **Kasrkin** operative within 5" horizontally of that marker is shooting an operative also within 5" horizontally of that marker, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule. In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, remove that marker.

## Kasrkin - Relocate
Select one friendly **Kasrkin** operative that's more than 3" from enemy operatives. That operative, and each other friendly **Kasrkin** operative that's both within 3" of that operative and more than 3" from enemy operatives, can immediately perform a free **Dash** action in an order of your choice. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

# Kasrkin Firefight Ploys

## Kasrkin - Seize The Initiative
Use this firefight ploy at the end of the firefight phase (excluding the final Firefight phase). In the Initiative step of the next Strategy phase, after rolling off to decide initiative, you can do one of the following:
- Re-roll your dice.
- Force your opponent to re-roll their dice.

## Kasrkin - Cover Retreat
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Kasrkin** operative performs the **Fall Back** action while visible to and within 6" of another ready friendly **Kasrkin** operative that's not within control range of enemy operatives. After that friendly operative has finished moving, but before that **Fall Back** action ends, that other friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Shoot** action.

## Kasrkin - Neutralise Target
Use this firefight ploy after rolling your attack dice for a friendly **Kasrkin** operative, if it's shooting an operative that's expended and is either not in cover or is being scanned (see **Recon-Trooper**). You can re-roll any of your attack dice.

## Kasrkin - Give No Ground
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Kasrkin** operative's activation, or at the end of the Firefight phase. Select one of your mission markers or an objective marker. Until the end of that activation or until the start of the next turning point respectively, if the total APL of friendly **Kasrkin** operatives that contest that marker is 2, and the total APL of enemy operatives that contest it is the same, friendly **Kasrkin** operatives control that marker.

# Kasrkin Faction Equipment

## Kasrkin - Foregrip
Whenever a friendly **Kasrkin** operative is shooting an operative within 3" of it, ranged weapons on its datacard (excluding weapons that include 'pistol' in their name, e.g. hot-shot laspistol, all profiles of a plasma pistol, etc.) have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule.

## Kasrkin - Long-Range Scope
Whenever a friendly **Kasrkin** operative is shooting an operative more than 6" from it, in the Roll Attack Dice step, if you retain any critical successes, that friendly operative's hot-shot weapons (excluding hot-shot laspistol) have the **Saturate** weapon rule.

## Kasrkin - Relics Of Cadia
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Kasrkin** operative is shooting, if you roll two or more fails, you can discard one of them to retain another as a normal success instead.

## Kasrkin - Combat Daggers
Friendly **Kasrkin** operatives have the following melee weapon:
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|------|------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
| Melee | Combat dagger | 3 | 4+ | 3/4 | |
