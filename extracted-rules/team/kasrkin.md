### KASRKIN - Operatives - KASRKIN COMBAT MEDIC - Medic!
The first time during each turning point that another friendly **KASRKIN** operative would be **incapacitated** while **visible** to and **wholly within 3"** of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within control range of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn't **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within this operative's control range. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends.
