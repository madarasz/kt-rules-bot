# Blooded Faction Rules

## Blooded
You gain one Blooded token:
*   In the Ready step of each Strategy phase.
*   The first time an enemy operative is incapacitated during each turning point.
*   The first time a friendly operative is incapacitated within 6" of an enemy operative during each turning point.

As a Strategic Gambit, you can assign any of your unassigned Blooded tokens to friendly **Blooded** operatives. Each operative cannot have more than one of your Blooded tokens. Then, if four or more friendly operatives in the killzone have one of your Blooded tokens, you can select one of them to be under the **Gaze of the Gods** until the end of the turning point.

Whenever a friendly **Blooded** operative has one of your Blooded tokens, its weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule. If that friendly **Blooded** operative is under the **Gaze of the Gods**, you can retain one of your normal successes as a result of the **Accurate 1** weapon rule as a critical success instead.

Until the end of the turning point, whenever a friendly **Blooded** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against that enemy operative, that shooting, fighting or retaliating operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule, or **Relentless** if it has one of your Blooded tokens.

## Blooded - Reckless Aspirant

Whenever a friendly **Blooded** operative that has one of your Blooded tokens is wholly within your opponent's territory, its weapons have the **Punishing** weapon rule.

## Blooded - Malevolent Grit

## Blooded - Bitter Demise
Whenever a friendly **Blooded** operative is incapacitated, before it's removed from the killzone, roll one D3: on a 3 (or 2+ if that friendly operative has one of your Blooded tokens), inflict damage equal to the result on one enemy operative visible to and within 2" of that friendly operative.

# Blooded Firefight Ploys

## Blooded - Callous Disregard
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Blooded** operative performs the **Shoot** action and you're selecting a valid target. Having other friendly **Blooded** operatives within an enemy operative's control range doesn't prevent that enemy operative from being selected. Until the end of that action, whenever you discard an attack dice as a fail, inflict damage equal to the dice result on one friendly operative of your choice within control range of the target.

## Blooded - Moment of Repute
Use this firefight ploy during the activation of a friendly **Blooded** operative that's under the **Gaze of the Gods**, before or after it performs an action. Until the end of that operative's activation, add 1 to its APL stat.

## Blooded - Reward Earned
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative is incapacitated by a friendly **Blooded** operative within 2" of it that has one of your Blooded tokens. You gain one Blooded token.

## Blooded - Dark Favour
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Blooded** operative that has one of your Blooded tokens is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **Blooded** operative visible to and within 3" of that first friendly operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being within the fighting operative's control range for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only in cover or obscured if the original target was.

This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

# Blooded Faction Equipment

## Blooded - Chaos Sigil
The **Reward Earned** firefight ploy costs you 0CP.

## Blooded - Sinister Trophies
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a friendly **Blooded** operative that has one of your Blooded tokens and is within 2" of it, your opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice results of 1.

## Blooded - Symbols of Bloody Worship
Whenever a friendly **Blooded** operative ends an action, if it wasn't incapacitated but inflicted damage on any enemy operatives during that action, it regains 1 lost wound.

## Blooded - Wicked Blades
Add 1 to both Dmg stats of each friendly **Blooded** operative's bayonet, bayonet & shield and improvised blade for the battle.
