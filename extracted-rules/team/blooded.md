# BLOODED FACTION RULES

## BLOODED
The Blooded seek to earn the favour of malign warp entities by hurling themselves into combat and slaying the most potent foes. Should they die in the attempt, their souls may serve as acceptable sacrifices.

You gain one Blooded token:
*   In the Ready step of each Strategy phase.
*   The first time an enemy operative is incapacitated during each turning point.
*   The first time a friendly operative is incapacitated within 6" of an enemy operative during each turning point.

As a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT**, you can assign any of your unassigned Blooded tokens to friendly **BLOODED** operatives. Each operative cannot have more than one of your Blooded tokens. Then, if four or more friendly operatives in the killzone have one of your Blooded tokens, you can select one of them to be under the **GAZE OF THE GODS** until the end of the turning point.

Whenever a friendly **BLOODED** operative has one of your Blooded tokens, its weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule. If that friendly **BLOODED** operative is under the **GAZE OF THE GODS**, you can retain one of your normal successes as a result of the **Accurate 1** weapon rule as a critical success instead.

**Keywords:** BLOODED, CHAOS, TROOPER

# BLOODED STRATEGY PLOYS

## BLOODED - GLORY KILL
By bringing down the strongest and most capable of enemies, the Blooded may provide a worthy offering to the Ruinous Powers.

Select one enemy operative visible to a friendly **BLOODED** operative. Until the end of the turning point, whenever a friendly **BLOODED** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against that enemy operative, that shooting, fighting or retaliating operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule, or **Relentless** if it has one of your Blooded tokens.

## BLOODED - RECKLESS ASPIRANT
No coward can earn glory. The Blooded are willing to risk life and limb in pursuit of malefic warp powers.

Whenever a friendly **BLOODED** operative that's wholly within your opponent's territory and doesn't have one of your Blooded tokens is shooting or fighting, its weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule.

Whenever a friendly **BLOODED** operative that has one of your Blooded tokens is wholly within your opponent's territory, its weapons have the **Punishing** weapon rule.

## BLOODED - MALEVOLENT GRIT
Those that have earned the favour of the Dark Gods of Chaos may draw upon the warp to predict and avoid the bullets of their foes.

Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **BLOODED** operative that has one of your Blooded tokens or is wholly within your opponent's territory, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## BLOODED - BITTER DEMISE
Consumed by hatred, the Blooded spit, curse and lash out as they die, screaming aggrieved words of heresy as they land a final strike upon the foe.

Whenever a friendly **BLOODED** operative is incapacitated, before it's removed from the killzone, roll one D3: on a 3 (or 2+ if that friendly operative has one of your Blooded tokens), inflict damage equal to the result on one enemy operative visible to and within 2" of that friendly operative.

# BLOODED FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## BLOODED - CALLOUS DISREGARD
Pity is a trait of the weak. The Blooded will gladly turn their guns upon their own kin if doing so will ensure the destruction of an enemy.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **BLOODED** operative performs the **Shoot** action and you're selecting a valid target. Having other friendly **BLOODED** operatives within an enemy operative's control range doesn't prevent that enemy operative from being selected. Until the end of that action, whenever you discard an attack dice as a fail, inflict damage equal to the dice result on one friendly operative of your choice within control range of the target.

## BLOODED - MOMENT OF REPUTE
When infused with a portion of the Dark Gods' power, the Blooded are lent infernal speed and aggression.

Use this firefight ploy during the activation of a friendly **BLOODED** operative that's under the **GAZE OF THE GODS**, before or after it performs an action. Until the end of that operative's activation, add 1 to its APL stat.

## BLOODED - REWARD EARNED
The surest way to earn the attention of the Ruinous Powers is to draw blood in their name.

Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative is incapacitated by a friendly **BLOODED** operative within 2" of it that has one of your Blooded tokens. You gain one Blooded token.

## BLOODED - DARK FAVOUR
Those who have spilled the blood of the foe and earned the favour of their infernal patron may be spared from death, as long as another pays the price in their stead.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **BLOODED** operative that has one of your Blooded tokens is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **BLOODED** operative visible to and within 3" of that first friendly operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being within the fighting operative's control range for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only in cover or obscured if the original target was.

This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

# BLOODED FACTION EQUIPMENT

## BLOODED - CHAOS SIGIL
The disquieting sigils carried by the Blooded bend reality and thin the veil between realspace and the ever-shifting tides of the warp.

The Reward Earned firefight ploy costs you 0CP.

## BLOODED - SINISTER TROPHIES
The Blooded adorn their armour with severed heads affixed to rusty spikes, cloaks and tabards of flayed skin, and all manner of other grisly trophies hacked from the corpses of their victims.

Whenever an enemy operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a friendly **BLOODED** operative that has one of your Blooded tokens and is within 2" of it, your opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice results of 1.

## BLOODED - SYMBOLS OF BLOODY WORSHIP
Desperate to garner the favour of malefic warp entities, the Blooded will daub their armour with bloody runes and take risks to be imbued with malevolent power.

Whenever a friendly **BLOODED** operative ends an action, if it wasn't incapacitated but inflicted damage on any enemy operatives during that action, it regains 1 lost wound.

## BLOODED - WICKED BLADES
The Ruinous Powers respect nothing so much as the lethal arena of close combat, and so the Blooded seek to plunge their wickedly sharp weapons into the flesh of their foes.

Add 1 to both Dmg stats of each friendly **BLOODED** operative's bayonet, bayonet & shield and improvised blade for the battle.
