## BLOODED - Archetypes
- SEEK & DESTROY
- INFILTRATION

## BLOODED - Faction Rule - BLOODED
The **Blooded** seek to earn the favour of malign warp entities by hurling themselves into combat and slaying the most potent foes. Should they die in the attempt, their souls may serve as acceptable sacrifices.

You gain one Blooded token:
- In the Ready step of each Strategy phase.
- The first time an enemy operative is **incapacitated** during each turning point.
- The first time a friendly operative is **incapacitated** within 6" of an enemy operative during each turning point.

As a STRATEGIC GAMBIT, you can assign any of your unassigned Blooded tokens to friendly **BLOODED** operatives. Each operative cannot have more than one of your Blooded tokens. Then, if four or more friendly operatives in the killzone have one of your Blooded tokens, you can select one of them to be under the **GAZE OF THE GODS** until the end of the turning point.

Whenever a friendly **BLOODED** operative has one of your Blooded tokens, its weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule. If that friendly **BLOODED** operative is under the **GAZE OF THE GODS**, you can retain one of your normal successes as a result of the **Accurate 1** weapon rule as a critical success instead.

This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.
