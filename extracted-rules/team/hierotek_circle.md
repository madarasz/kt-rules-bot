## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Archetypes
- RECON
- SECURITY

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Faction Rule - REANIMATION PROTOCOLS
The first time each friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE** operative is **incapacitated**, before it's removed from the killzone, place one of your Reanimation markers within its **control range**. Then remove it as **incapacitated**, also removing any tokens and rules effects it had (e.g. **CHRONOMANCER** operative's **Chronometron** action, Poison tokens, APL stat changes, being implanted, etc.).

In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, select one of your Reanimation markers and roll one D6: on a 1-2, leave that Reanimation marker in the killzone and repeat this process with a different one of your Reanimation markers (if any); on a 3+, an operative is **REANIMATED**.

You can only select each of your Reanimation markers once per turning point, and once you roll a 3+, you don't select any more for that turning point. Whenever an operative is **REANIMATED**:
- Set up the operative that Reanimation marker was placed for (it's no longer **incapacitated**). It must be placed within 3" of that Reanimation marker and not within **control range** of enemy operatives (if you cannot do so, treat the roll as 1-2 instead).
- It has 1 wound remaining.
- It has an order of your choice and is ready.
- Remove that Reanimation marker.

As **REANIMATED** operatives are no longer **incapacitated**, for the purposes of the kill op, this means your opponent's kill grade can go down during the battle (they lose VP accordingly). However, it won't retroactively change any other VPs your opponent has scored, e.g. from tac ops.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Faction Rule - MAGNIFY
Some **HIEROTEK CIRCLE APPRENTEK** and **HIEROTEK CIRCLE CRYPTEK** weapons in this team's rules have the **Magnify** weapon rule below.

**Magnify**: Whenever this operative is performing the **Shoot** action with this weapon, if another friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE APPRENTEK** or **HIEROTEK CIRCLE CRYPTEK** operative has an **Engage** order and is **visible** to this operative, you can use this rule. If you do, treat that operative as the active operative for the purposes of determining a valid target, **cover** and **obscured**. If you do, this weapon has the **Ceaseless** weapon rule until the end of that action.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Faction Rule - LIVING METAL
In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, after resolving all other rules in this step (e.g. **Reanimation Protocols** faction rule), each friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE** operative regains D3+1 lost wounds (roll separately for each).

Whenever determining **control** of a marker, treat the total APL stat of enemy operatives that contest it as 1 lower if at least one of those enemy operatives is within 2" of your Despair marker.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Strategy Ploy - RELENTLESS ONSLAUGHT
Whenever a friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE** operative is shooting an operative within 8" of it, that friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule. Note that when you're using the **Magnify** weapon rule, this operative must still be within 8" of the target to use this rule (not the other friendly operative from which you're determining a valid target).

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Strategy Ploy - UNDYING ANDROIDS
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE** operative, if you cannot retain any **cover** saves, you can retain one of your defence dice as a normal success without rolling it.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Strategy Ploy - METHODICAL ELIMINATION
Friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE** operatives' melee weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule. Whenever a friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE** operative is fighting during an activation in which it hasn't moved more than its Move stat, or whenever it's retaliating, its melee weapons have the **Accurate 2** weapon rule instead.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE APPRENTEK** or **HIEROTEK CIRCLE CRYPTEK** operative performs a **SUPPORT** unique action. Until the end of that action, for the purposes of selecting another friendly operative, ignore the distance requirement (only visibility is a requirement).

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Firefight Ploy - REANIMATED FUNCTION
Use this firefight ploy when determining **control** of a marker. Select one of your Reanimation markers. Until the start of the next turning point, whenever determining **control** of a marker, treat that Reanimation marker as a friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE** operative that has an APL stat of 1.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Firefight Ploy - LIVING LIGHTNING
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE IMMORTAL** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a tesla carbine. Until the end of that action, that weapon doesn't have the 2" from its **Devastating** weapon rule but has the **Blast 2"** weapon rule.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Firefight Ploy - DIMENSIONAL AMBUSH
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE DEATHMARK** operative's activation, if it has a **Conceal** order. During that activation, that operative can perform the **Guard** action regardless of the killzone and while it has a **Conceal** order (see close quarters rules, Kill Team Core Book), but when you perform the free **Shoot** or **Fight** action during the interruption, you must change its order to **Engage**.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Faction Equipment - MAGNIFICATION CONDUITS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE APPRENTEK** or **HIEROTEK CIRCLE CRYPTEK** operative is performing the **Shoot** action, you can use this rule. If you do, select one other friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE** operative (excluding **PLASMACYTE**) that has an **Engage** order and is **visible** to that friendly operative. Until the end of that action, that other friendly operative can be treated as the active operative for the **Magnify** weapon rule.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Faction Equipment - PHASE SHIFTER
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **CRYPTEK** operative, at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you can use this rule. If you do, worsen the x of the **Piercing** weapon rule by 1 (if any) until the end of that sequence. Note that **Piercing 1** would therefore be ignored.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Faction Equipment - TESSERACT CUBE
In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, when you gain CP, if a friendly **CRYPTEK** operative isn't **incapacitated**, isn't within **control range** of enemy operatives and hasn't been **REANIMATED** this turning point, you can use this rule. If you do, roll one D6: on a 1, you cannot use this rule for the rest of the battle; on a 4+, you gain 1CP. Once you have gained 2CP from this rule, you cannot use it for the rest of the battle.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Faction Equipment - TESLA WEAVE
Once per turning point, when an enemy operative ends the **Charge** action with friendly **HIEROTEK CIRCLE** operatives within its **control range**, you can use this rule. If you do, inflict D3+1 damage on that enemy operative.

## HIEROTEK CIRCLE - Rules Commentaries
[FAQ]
*Question*: How does the **Steadfast** rule interact with rules that treat the total APL stat of enemy operatives as 1 lower, e.g. **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM**’s **Terror**?
*Answer*: **The Steadfast rule would treat the relevant operative’s APL stat as 3, but the total APL of those contesting a marker would still be reduced by 1. For example, if one friendly operative that had both the Steadfast rule and was affected by Terror contested a marker, the total APL would be 2; if two friendly operatives with the same conditions contested a marker, the total APL would be 5, etc.**
