## RATLING KILL TEAM - Operative Selection
A **RATLING** kill team consists of 1 **RATLING FIXER** operative and 10 **RATLING** operatives selected from the following list:
- **BATTLEMUTT**
- **BULLGRYN***
- **OGRYN***
- **BIG SHOT**
- **BOMBER**
- **HARDBIT**
- **RAIDER**
- **SNEAK**
- **SNIPER**
- **SPOTTER**
- **STASHMASTER**
- **VOX-THIEF**

Your kill team can only include each operative on the list once, other than **BULLGRYN**, **OGRYN** and **SNIPER** operatives.

The **RATLING FIXER** operative must be equipped with one of the following options:
- Battle rifle; fists
- Sniper rifle; fists

The **BULLGRYN** operative must be equipped with one option from each of the following:
- Grenadier gauntlet or power maul
- Brute shield or slabshield

*You cannot select more than three **BULLGRYN** and **OGRYN** operatives combined. Up to three times, instead of selecting one of these operatives, you can select one **RATLING** ploy to cost you 0CP for the battle.

Some **RATLING** rules refer to a 'rifle'. This is a ranged weapon that includes 'rifle' in its name, e.g. tankstopper rifle, all profiles of a sniper rifle, etc.

- INFILTRATION

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Faction Rule - SCARPER
Despite their small stature, Ratlings are fleet of foot, using their speed and agility to outpace and evade their foes.

After each enemy operative's activation, before the next operative is activated, you can perform a free **Dash** action with one friendly **RATLING** operative (excluding **BULLGRYN**, **OGRYN** and **SNEAK**), but it cannot end that move within 3" of an enemy operative unless it's not **visible** to every enemy operative when it ends that move.

Each friendly operative can only do this once per turning point, and cannot do so after the final activation of the turning point. You cannot use this rule after consecutive enemy activations during the same turning point (in other words, after using this rule, you must skip the next opportunity during that turning point before you can use it again).

### RATLING KILL TEAM - Operatives - RATLING BATTLEMUTT - Early Warning
Once per turning point, after an enemy operative performs an action in which it moves, you can interrupt that activation/counteraction to use this rule.

In either case, each one cannot end that move within 2" of an enemy operative unless it's not **visible** to every enemy operative when it ends that move (if this isn't possible for an operative, it cannot move).

### RATLING KILL TEAM - Operatives - RATLING BOMBER - Tripwire
When setting up equipment before the battle, you can set up to two of your Tripwire markers up **wholly within** your territory and more than 2" from other markers, access points and Accessible terrain. The first time that marker is within an enemy operative's **control range**, remove that marker, subtract 1 from that operative's APL stat until the end of its next activation and end its action (if any), even if that action's effects aren't fulfilled. If it cannot be placed, move it the minimum amount to do so.

### RATLING KILL TEAM - Operatives - RATLING BOMBER - Mine
Mines you select from universal equipment inflict 2D3+3 damage instead, and friendly **RATLING** operatives (excluding **OGRYN** and **BULLGRYN**) are ignored for your mines' effects (i.e. they cannot trigger or take damage from them). This takes precedence over the normal mines rules.

### RATLING KILL TEAM - Operatives - RATLING RAIDER - Grappling Hook
Whenever this operative is climbing up, you can treat the vertical distance as 2" (regardless of how far the operative actually moves vertically).

### RATLING KILL TEAM - Operatives - RATLING RAIDER - SLINGSHOT
**1AP:** Select a point on a terrain feature; that point must be **visible** to, within 6" horizontally of and higher than this operative. Remove this operative from the killzone and set it back up **wholly within** x+1" horizontally of that point, not within **control range** of enemy operatives, and with that point **visible** to it. X is that point's height, rounded to the nearest inch (to a maximum of 5"). This action is treated as a **Reposition** action.

### RATLING KILL TEAM - Operatives - RATLING VOX-THIEF - INTERCEPT COMMUNICATIONS
**1AP:** **SUPPORT.** Select one other friendly **RATLING** operative **visible** to and within 6" of this operative. Until the end of its next activation, add 1 to that operative's APL stat. This operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Strategy Ploy - SNIPER POSITIONS
Whenever a friendly **RATLING** operative is more than 6" from enemy operatives and within 1" of **Heavy** terrain, the stationary profile of its rifle (if any) has the **Silent** weapon rule.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Strategy Ploy - CRACK SHOTS
Whenever a friendly **RATLING** operative is shooting an enemy operative more than 6" from it, if that friendly operative hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action during the activation, or if it's a counteraction, its rifle (if any) has the **Balanced** weapon rule. Note that operative isn't restricted from performing those actions after shooting.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Strategy Ploy - SHIFTY
Whenever a friendly **RATLING** operative (excluding **OGRYN** or **BULLGRYN**) has a **Conceal** order and is **in cover**, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. Seek, Vantage terrain) except being within 2".

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Strategy Ploy - FRONTLINE ASSAULT
Whenever a friendly **RATLING BULLGRYN** or friendly **RATLING OGRYN** operative within your opponent's territory or within 3" of an objective marker is shooting, fighting or retaliating, its weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Firefight Ploy - SURVIVAL INSTINCTS
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative is shooting against or fighting against a friendly **RATLING** operative (excluding **OGRYN** or **BULLGRYN**) and you're allocating a dice to block. If it's a normal success, it can block one unresolved critical success; if it's a critical success, it can block two unresolved successes (normal or critical).

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Firefight Ploy - SHARPSHOT
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **RATLING** operative is performing the **Shoot** action with a rifle and you're selecting a valid target. Having other friendly **RATLING** operatives within an enemy operative's **control range** doesn't prevent that enemy operative from being selected.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Firefight Ploy - LARCENOUS
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **RATLING** operative's activation (excluding **OGRYN** or **BULLGRYN**). Until the end of that activation, that operative doesn't have to control a marker to perform the **Pick Up Marker** or mission actions that usually require this (this takes precedence over that action's conditions - it only needs to contest the marker), and having an enemy operative within its **control range** doesn't prevent it from doing so.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Firefight Ploy - SHOOT AND HIDE
Use this firefight ploy after a friendly **RATLING** operative that has an **Engage** order performs the **Shoot** action with a rifle. If it's more than 3" from enemy operatives, or not **visible** to every enemy operative, you can change its order to **Conceal**.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Faction Equipment - PURLOINED RATIONS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **RATLING** operative (excluding **BATTLEMUTT**, **BULLGRYN** and **OGRYN**) is activated, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that activation, improve the Hit stat of its rifle (if any) by 1.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Faction Equipment - LUCKY ROUND
Once per turning point, when a friendly **RATLING** operative is shooting with a rifle and you've rolled your attack dice, you can use this rule if you haven't used the Purloined Rations equipment this activation. If you do, that weapon has the **Severe** weapon rule until the end of that sequence.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Faction Equipment - STOLEN GOODS
At the end of the Select Operatives step, roll one D3. If the result is:
- 1, you lose 1CP.
- 2, you gain 1CP.
- 3, your opponent loses 1CP.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Faction Equipment - IMPROVISED ARMOUR
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **RATLING BULLGRYN** or friendly **RATLING OGRYN** operative, defence dice results of 5+ are critical successes.

## RATLING KILL TEAM - Rules Commentary
[FAQ]
*Question:* Can you clarify what the Team Selection page means when saying 'Up to three times, instead of selecting one of these operatives, you can select one **RATLING** ploy to cost you 0CP for the battle' in reference to **BULLGRYN** and **OGRYN** operatives?
*Answer:* A **RATLING** kill team always consists of one **RATLING FIXER** and ten additional operatives. Up to three of those additional operatives can be **BULLGRYN** or **OGRYN**. For each of those three that is not, you select a different **RATLING** operative and one ploy to cost you 0CP for the battle.

[FAQ]
*Question:* Can you clarify what 'you cannot use this rule after consecutive enemy activations' means in the **Scarper** rule?
*Answer:* After each enemy operative's activation, there is a possible opportunity to use **Scarper**. Whenever you use one of these opportunities to perform a free **Dash** action with a friendly operative, you must pass on your next opportunity to do so.
