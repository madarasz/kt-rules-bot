# BLADES OF KHAINE FACTION RULES

## BLADES OF KHAINE - ASPECT TECHNIQUES
Aspect Warriors are trained in myriad killing techniques, parrying blows and acrobatic movements. These are as breathtaking to behold as they are lethal to their foes.

Each **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** is in a category: Dire Avenger, Howling Banshee and Striking Scorpion. Each **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** can only be used with a friendly operative that has the matching Aspect keyword, and each will specify when it can be used and what its effects are. In addition:
- You cannot use more than one **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** per activation or counteraction.
- You cannot use each **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** more than once per turning point.
- If every friendly **BLADES OF KHAINE** operative selected for deployment has the same Aspect keyword (e.g. **STRIKING SCORPION**), you cannot use each **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** more than twice per turning point (instead of once).

### HOWLING BANSHEE ASPECT TECHNIQUES

#### THE WOE
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** during a friendly **HOWLING BANSHEE** operative's activation, after it's performed the **Charge** action and incapacitated an enemy operative during the **Fight** action, and is no longer within control range of enemy operatives. That friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Charge** action using any remaining move distance it had from that first **Charge** action. That operative can perform two **Charge** actions during its activation to do so. The operative cannot have performed any other actions during this activation (but can do so after resolving this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE**).

#### RAIN OF TEARS
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **HOWLING BANSHEE** operative is fighting, after you strike with a critical success. End that sequence (any remaining attack dice are discarded) and immediately perform a free **Dash** or **Fall Back** action up to 3" with that operative (then the **Fight** action ends). That operative can do so even if it's performed an action that prevents it from performing the **Dash** or **Fall Back** action.

#### ACROBATIC
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **HOWLING BANSHEE** operative performs an action in which it moves. Until the end of the action, that operative:
- Can ignore all vertical distances whenever it drops and climbs.
- Can move through enemy operatives, move within control range of them, and during the **Charge** action can leave their control range (it must still end the move following all requirements for that move).
- Cannot move more than its Move stat if it's the **Charge** action.

#### SCREAM-THAT-STEALS
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **HOWLING BANSHEE** operative is fighting or retaliating, at the start of the Resolve Attack Dice step. You can resolve one of your successes before the normal order. If you do, that success must be used to block.

#### SHRIEK-THAT-KILLS
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **HOWLING BANSHEE** operative is performing the **Shoot** action. Until the end of that action, that operative can use the following ranged weapon:
| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shriek-that-kills | 6 | 3+ | 1/2 | Range 6", Saturate, Seek Light, Stun, Torrent 1" |

### DIRE AVENGER ASPECT TECHNIQUES

#### THE SLICING HURRICANE
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **DIRE AVENGER** operative is performing the **Reposition** action. That operative can perform the **Shoot** action during that action (it must do so in a location it can be placed, and any remaining move distance it had from that **Reposition** action can be used after it does so). You must select its shuriken catapult, shuriken pistol or twin shuriken catapult for that **Shoot** action.

#### DEATH OF A THOUSAND BLADES
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **DIRE AVENGER** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a shuriken catapult or twin shuriken catapult. Until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Torrent 2"** weapon rule, but you cannot select more than one secondary target.

#### VIGILANCE OF THE AVENGER
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **DIRE AVENGER** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a shuriken catapult or twin shuriken catapult. Until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Lethal 5+** weapon rule.

#### UNSTINTING, IMMOVABLE
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when an operative is shooting a friendly **DIRE AVENGER** operative, and you've rolled two or more fails. You can discard one of them to retain the other as a normal success instead.

#### RAGING HEAT OF THE DYING FLAME
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** during a friendly **DIRE AVENGER** operative's activation. Until the start of that operative's next activation, you can ignore any changes to its stats from being injured (including its weapons' stats).

### STRIKING SCORPION ASPECT TECHNIQUES

#### PATIENT STALK, SUDDEN BLOW
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **STRIKING SCORPION** operative that has a **Conceal** order performs the **Reposition** action. During that action, that operative can move within control range of enemy operatives (it cannot end the move there), and you can inflict D3+2 damage on one enemy operative it moved within control range of after it's moved.

#### STRIKE AND FADE
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **STRIKING SCORPION** operative incapacitates an enemy operative while fighting or retaliating, and is no longer within 3" of enemy operatives. Change that friendly operative's order to **Conceal** and it can immediately perform a free **Dash** action, even if it's performed an action that prevents it from performing the **Dash** action.

#### SCORPION'S EYE
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **STRIKING SCORPION** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a shuriken pistol. Until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Seek Light** weapon rule.

#### MERCILESS STRIKES
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** when a friendly **STRIKING SCORPION** operative is fighting, the first time you strike with a critical success during that sequence. Until the end of that sequence, that operative's melee weapon has the **Shock** weapon rule.

#### ONE WITH THE GLOOM
Use this **ASPECT TECHNIQUE** during a friendly **STRIKING SCORPION** operative's activation. Until the start of its next activation, while that operative has a **Conceal** order and is in cover, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. **Seek**, Vantage terrain) except being within 2".
