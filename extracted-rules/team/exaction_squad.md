# Exaction Squad Faction Rules

## Exaction Squad - Ruthless Efficiency
A target, whether marked to be apprehended or eliminated, stands little chance of escaping the attentions of an Adeptus Arbites Exaction Squad.

Whenever a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative is shooting (excluding with frag or krak grenade), before you select a valid target, you can use this rule if you do, saving other friendly **Exaction Squad** operatives within an enemy operative's control range doesn't prevent that enemy operative from being selected.

## Exaction Squad - Marked For Justice
Exaction Squads prioritise their targets, focusing their ire on those marked for immediate punishment before moving on to the next transgressor.

STRATEGIC GAMBIT. Select one enemy operative to be your mark for that turning point. Whenever a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against your mark, that friendly operative's weapons have the Rending weapon rule. Whenever your mark is incapacitated, you can select a new enemy operative to be your mark for the turning point (you can continue to do so during this turning point).

## Exaction Squad - Repress
Some weapons in this team's rules have the **Repress** weapon rule, as below:

**Repress:** Whenever this operative is using this weapon:
- Each of your blocks can be allocated to block two of the attacker's normal hits (instead of one).
- If this operative is retaliating, you resolve the first attack dice (i.e. defender instead of attacker).

    - Whenever determining control of a marker, treat the total APL of friendly operatives within 3" of it as being 1 higher if at least one of those enemy operatives is within 3" of your Nuncio-aquila marker (or this operative if your Nuncio-aquila marker isn't in the killzone). Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

# Exaction Squad Strategy Ploys

## Exaction Squad - Guilt Reveals Itself
Whenever you're selecting a valid target for a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative, enemy operatives within 4" of it cannot be in cover (instead of 2"). While this can allow such operatives to be targeted (assuming they're visible), it doesn't remove their cover save (if any), but you can use friendly **Exaction Squad** operative is within 2" as normal.

## Exaction Squad - Inviolate Jurisdiction
Emboldened by the authority they hold, Exaction Squads will fight with zealous determination to hold key positions against the foe.
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative that is within 2" of an objective marker or an enemy operative, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## Exaction Squad - Dispense Justice
Whenever a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative is fighting or retaliating, if it hasn't moved more than its Move stat during the activation, or if it's a counteraction, its melee weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

## Exaction Squad - Terminal Decree
Whenever a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative is shooting an enemy operative within 6" of it, or whenever a friendly **Exaction Squad Gunner** operative is shooting, that friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.

# Exaction Squad Firefight Ploys

## Exaction Squad - Long Arm Of The Emperor's Law
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a weapon with the **Range x** weapon rule (excluding frag or krak grenade). Until the end of that action, add 3" to x.

## Exaction Squad - Exact Punishment
Use this firefight ploy after an enemy operative shoots against or fights against a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative within 6" of it, and that friendly operative isn't incapacitated as a result. That friendly operative can immediately perform either a free **Shoot** or a free **Fight** action, but you cannot select any other enemy operative as a valid target or to fight against during that action (note that secondary targets from the **Blast** weapon rule can still be targeted).

## Exaction Squad - Brutal Backup
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action. Select one enemy operative within its control range. That other friendly **Exaction Squad** operative can immediately perform a free **Fight** action, but you cannot select any other enemy operative to fight against during that action.

## Exaction Squad - Execution Order
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative performs a mission action (excluding **Operate Hatch**). Alternatively, use it at the end of the Firefight phase and select one enemy operative that controls an objective marker.

In either case, the next time your opponent would activate that enemy operative, you can interrupt that activation and activate a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative. If you do, during that activation, that friendly operative must fight against or shoot against that enemy operative, and cannot do so against any other enemy operative until it does (if it isn't possible, that friendly operative's activation is cancelled).

After completing that friendly operative's activation, continue that enemy operative's activation (if possible). You cannot use this ploy again until that enemy operative is activated or incapacitated.

# Exaction Squad Faction Equipment

## Exaction Squad - Reinforced Mirror-Visor
The armoured visor is designed to shield the wearer from blinding and disorientating weapons or devices.

You can ignore any changes to the APL stats of friendly **Exaction Squad** operatives, and they aren't affected by enemy operatives' **Shock** weapon rule.

## Exaction Squad - Manacles
Whenever an enemy operative would perform the **Fall Back** action while within control range of a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative, if no other enemy operatives are within that enemy operative's control range, you can use this rule. If you do, roll one D6: on a 4+, if that enemy operative has a higher Wounds stat than that friendly operative. If any result is a 4+, that enemy operative cannot perform that action during that activation/counteraction (no AP are spent on it).

## Exaction Squad - Strobing Phosphor-Lumen
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative within 2" of it, your opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice results of 1.

## Exaction Squad - Special Issue Shells
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Exaction Squad** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a combat shotgun, executioner shotgun, scoped shotpistol or shotpistol, you can use this rule. If you do, select one of the following weapon rules for that weapon to have until the end of that action:
- **Saturate**.
- **Piercing 1**, but only if the target has a Save stat of 3+ or better.
- **Torrent 1"**, but you cannot select more than one secondary target.

# Exaction Squad Rules Commentary
[FAQ]
*Question*: My **Leashmaster** and **R-VR Cyber-Mastiff** operatives are activating simultaneously as a result of the Handler rule. Can I use the Brutal Backup firefight ploy to select one of those operatives that has already performed a **Fight** action during that activation to fight again?
*Answer*: No.

[FAQ]
*Question*: When using the Guilt Reveals Itself strategy ploy, if my opponent has a rule that says it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. by being within 1" (e.g. **Hierotek Yaqir** in Position)), does this increase the 2" distance exception to 4"?
*Answer*: Yes.
