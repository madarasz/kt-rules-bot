## EXACTION SQUAD - Archetypes
- SECURITY
- SEEK & DESTROY

## EXACTION SQUAD - Faction Rule - RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY
A target, whether marked to be apprehended or eliminated, stands little chance of escaping the attention of an Adeptus Arbites Exaction Squad.

Whenever a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative is shooting (excluding with frag or krak grenades) and you’re selecting a valid target, you can use this rule. If you do, having other friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operatives within an enemy operative’s **control range** doesn’t prevent that enemy operative from being selected.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Faction Rule - MARKED FOR JUSTICE
Exaction Squads prioritise their targets, focusing their ire on those marked for immediate punishment before moving on to the next transgressor.

**STRATEGIC GAMBIT**. Select one enemy operative to be your mark for the turning point. Whenever a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against your mark, that friendly operative’s weapons have the Punishing weapon rule. Whenever your mark is **incapacitated**, you can select a new enemy operative to be your mark for the turning point (and can continue to do so during this turning point).

## EXACTION SQUAD - Faction Rule - REPRESS
Some weapons in this team’s rules have the **Repress** weapon rule below.

**Repress:** Whenever this operative is using this weapon:
- Each of your blocks can be allocated to block two unresolved successes (instead of one).
- If this operative is retaliating, you resolve the first attack dice (i.e. defender instead of attacker).

### EXACTION SQUAD - Operatives - ARBITES PROCTOR-EXACTANT - Assault Shield
If this operative has a dominator maul & assault shield, it has a 3+ Save stat.

### EXACTION SQUAD - Operatives - ARBITES PROCTOR-EXACTANT - Nuncio-aquila
- Whenever an enemy operative is within 3" of your Nuncio-aquila marker (or this operative if your Nuncio-aquila marker isn't in the killzone), your opponent must spend 1 additional AP for that enemy operative to perform the **Pick Up Marker** and mission actions.
- Whenever determining control of a marker, treat the total APL stat of enemy operatives that contest it as 1 lower if at least one of those enemy operatives is within 3" of your Nuncio-aquila marker (or this operative if your Nuncio-aquila marker isn't in the killzone). Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

### EXACTION SQUAD - Operatives - ARBITES PROCTOR-EXACTANT - DEPLOY NUNCIO-AQUILA
**0AP:** If your Nuncio-aquila marker isn't in the killzone, place it within 6" horizontally of this operative; otherwise, move your Nuncio-aquila marker up to 6" horizontally.

### EXACTION SQUAD - Operatives - ARBITES CHIRURGANT - Medic!
The first time during each turning point that another friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative would be **incapacitated** while **visible** to and within 3" of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within **control range** of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn't **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can then immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within this operative's **control range**. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is **incapacitated**, or if it's a **Shoot** action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Strategy Ploy - GUILT REVEALS ITSELF
Whenever you’re selecting a valid target for a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative, enemy operatives within 4" of it cannot be **in cover** (instead of 2"). While this can allow such operatives to be targeted (assuming they’re **visible**), it doesn’t remove their cover save (if any), unless the friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative is within 2" as normal.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Strategy Ploy - INVIOLATE JURISDICTION
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative that’s within 2" of an objective marker or an enemy operative, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Strategy Ploy - DISPENSE JUSTICE
Whenever a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative is fighting or retaliating, if it hasn’t moved more than its Move stat during the activation, or if it’s a counteraction, its melee weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Strategy Ploy - TERMINAL DECREE

## EXACTION SQUAD - Firefight Ploy - LONG ARM OF THE EMPEROR'S LAW
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a weapon with the **Range x** weapon rule (excluding frag or krak grenade). Until the end of that action, add 3" to x.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Firefight Ploy - EXACT PUNISHMENT
Use this firefight ploy after an enemy operative shoots against or fights against a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative within 6" of it, and that friendly operative isn’t **incapacitated** as a result. That friendly operative can immediately perform either a free **Shoot** or a free **Fight** action, but you cannot select any other enemy operative as a valid target or to fight against during that action (note that secondary targets from the **Blast** weapon rule can still be targeted).

## EXACTION SQUAD - Firefight Ploy - BRUTAL BACKUP
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative’s activation, before or after it performs an action. Select one enemy operative within its **control range**. One other friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative can immediately perform a free **Fight** action, but you cannot select any other enemy operative to fight against during that action.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Firefight Ploy - EXECUTION ORDER
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative performs a mission action (excluding **Operate Hatch**). Alternatively, use it at the end of the Firefight phase and select one enemy operative that controls an objective marker.
In either case, the next time your opponent would activate that enemy operative, you can interrupt that activation and activate a ready friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative. If you do, during that activation, that friendly operative must fight against or shoot against that enemy operative, and cannot do so against any other enemy operatives until it does (if this isn’t possible, that friendly operative’s activation is cancelled).
After completing that friendly operative’s activation, continue that enemy operative’s activation (if possible). You cannot use this ploy again until that enemy operative is activated or **incapacitated**.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Faction Equipment - REINFORCED MIRROR-VISOR
You can ignore any changes to the APL stats of friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operatives, and they aren’t affected by enemy operatives’ **Shock** weapon rule.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Faction Equipment - MANACLES
Whenever an enemy operative would perform the **Fall Back** action while within **control range** of a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative, if no other enemy operatives are within that friendly operative’s **control range**, you can use this rule. If you do, roll two D6, or one D6 if that enemy operative has a higher Wounds stat than that friendly operative. If any result is a 4+, that enemy operative cannot perform that action during that activation/counteraction (no AP are spent on it).

## EXACTION SQUAD - Faction Equipment - STROBING PHOSPHOR-LUMEN
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative within 2" of it, your opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice results of 1.

## EXACTION SQUAD - Faction Equipment - SPECIAL ISSUE SHELLS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **EXACTION SQUAD** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a combat shotgun, executioner shotgun, scoped shotpistol or shotpistol, you can use this rule. If you do, select one of the following weapon rules for that weapon to have until the end of that action:
- **Saturate**.
- **Piercing 1**, but only if the target has a Save stat of 3+ or better.
- **Torrent 1"**, but you cannot select more than one secondary target.
