# PATHFINDERS FACTION RULES

## MARKERLIGHTS

Some **PATHFINDER** operatives (indicated on their datacard) can perform the **Markerlight** unique action:

**MARKERLIGHT 1AP**

Select one enemy operative visible to this operative. That enemy operative gains one of your Markerlight tokens (to a maximum of four).

An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative. If an operative (excluding MB3 RECON) would perform the Shoot action (excluding Guard) and this action during the same activation, only the target of that Shoot action can be selected for this action (and vice versa).

Once during each of their activations, whenever an enemy operative that has any of your Markerlight tokens performs the Dash, Charge, Fall Back or Reposition action, remove one of those tokens.

While only some PATHFINDER operatives can perform the Markerlight action, all PATHFINDER operatives can benefit from its effects. Whenever a friendly PATHFINDER operative is shooting with a weapon from its datacard (excluding ASSAULT GRENADIER's fusion grenade), it has additional rules determined by the number of your Markerlight tokens the target has. These are cumulative, so if an enemy operative has two of your Markerlight tokens, the friendly operative shooting it has the rules for 1 and 2 tokens during that sequence.

**Markerlight Token Effects:**

| Tokens | Additional Rules |
|--------|------------------|
| 1 | Saturate and Balanced weapon rules |
| 2 | Improve the Hit stat of that friendly operative's ranged weapons by 1 (to a maximum of 3+) |
| 3 | The target cannot be obscured |
| 4 | Seek Light weapon rule |

- **Medic!:** The first time during each turning point that another friendly PATHFINDER operative (excluding DRONE) would be incapacitated while visible to and within 3" of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within control range of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn't incapacitated, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be incapacitated for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can immediately perform a free Dash action, but must end that move within this operative's control range. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is incapacitated, or if it's a Shoot action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.

# PATHFINDERS STRATEGY PLOYS

## RECON SWEEP

Pathfinders are tasked with reconnaissance roles and are skilled at crossing difficult terrain to outflank unsuspecting targets.

Select one killzone edge (excluding your own). Each friendly PATHFINDER operative that's wholly within 6" of that edge can immediately perform a free Dash action in an order of your choice, but each that does so must end that move wholly within 6" of a killzone edge (excluding your own). You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

## SUPPRESSING FIRE

T'au Pathfinders lay down a punishing blizzard of fire, forcing their enemies to take cover and fire back in scattered, desperate bursts.

Whenever an enemy operative is performing the Shoot action, if the target (the primary target if the weapon has the Blast or Torrent weapon rules) isn't the closest valid target, your opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice. Ignore friendly PATHFINDER operatives that have a Conceal order or are obscured when determining this.

## BONDED

Often trained together from youth and bonded by blood ritual, Fire Warrior teams possess an uncanny degree of coordination.

Whenever a friendly PATHFINDER operative (excluding DRONE) is shooting or retaliating with a ranged weapon (see Point-Blank Fusillade firefight ploy), if it's within 3" of another friendly PATHFINDER operative (excluding DRONE), that first friendly operative's ranged weapons have the Accurate 1 weapon rule.

## TAKE COVER

Pathfinders are lightly armoured and equipped for mobility. They must use surrounding terrain to their advantage in order to survive.

Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly PATHFINDER operative, if you can retain any cover saves, improve that friendly operative's Save stat by 1.

# PATHFINDERS FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## A WORTHY CAUSE

Any action that furthers the Greater Good must be undertaken swiftly and without question, no matter how dangerous.

Use this firefight ploy at the start of the Firefight phase. One friendly PATHFINDER operative (excluding DRONE) can immediately perform a free mission action.

## SUPPORTING FIRE

T'au Pathfinders are expert sharpshooters and can grant covering fire even to allies engaged in close combat.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly PATHFINDER operative is performing the Shoot action and you're selecting a valid target within 6" of it. Having other friendly PATHFINDER operatives within an enemy operative's control range doesn't prevent that enemy operative from being selected.

## SAVIOUR PROTOCOLS

T'au drones are hard-coded to prioritise the safety of their operators, and will automatically interpose themselves between a T'au warrior and an incoming attack.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly PATHFINDER operative (excluding DRONE) is selected as the valid target of a Shoot action. Select one friendly PATHFINDER DRONE operative visible to and within 3" of that first friendly operative to become the valid target instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). That friendly DRONE operative is only in cover or obscured if the original target was. This ploy has no effect if the ranged weapon has the Blast or Torrent weapon rule.

## POINT-BLANK FUSILLADE

Wielding their ranged weapons with practised skill, Pathfinders are capable of utilising them even at close quarters.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly PATHFINDER operative (excluding DRONE) is retaliating, if it wasn't within control range of enemy operatives at the start of that activation/counteraction. You can use one of its ranged weapons as a melee weapon (excluding a weapon that has the word 'grenade' in its name) during that sequence. If you do, you cannot block during that sequence, and the following weapon rules have no effect on its weapons until the end of that sequence: Devastating, Piercing, Torrent. If that friendly operative is ready, has an Engage order and is retaliating with a pulse weapon, you resolve the first attack dice (i.e. defender instead of attacker).

# PATHFINDERS FACTION EQUIPMENT

## TARGET ANALYSIS OPTIC

Advanced optics enhance the effectiveness of markerlights, ensuring the bearer's shots find their mark with unerring accuracy.

Once per turning point, when a friendly PATHFINDER operative (excluding DRONE) is performing the Shoot action and you're selecting a valid target, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, if the target has at least one of your Markerlight tokens, it's treated as having one more. If the ranged weapon has the Blast or Torrent weapon rule, only the primary target is affected.

## HIGH-INTENSITY MARKERLIGHT

This markerlight is exceptionally effective, its beam traceable even through obscuring smoke, debris and soft cover.

Once per turning point, when a friendly PATHFINDER operative (excluding MV7 MARKER DRONE) performs the Markerlight action, you can use this rule. If you do, the enemy operative you select gains two of your Markerlight tokens (instead of one).

## PHOTON GRENADE

Upon reaching their destination, photon grenades release bright pulses of multispectrum light that blind and shock those caught in the blast.

Once per turning point, a friendly PATHFINDER operative that has the Markerlight action on their datacard (excluding DRONE) can perform the following unique action:

**PHOTON GRENADE 1AP**

Select a valid target for this operative and roll one D6: on a 3+, until the end of that operative's next activation, subtract 2" from its Move stat and it cannot perform the Dash action.

An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## ORBITAL SURVEY UPLINK

So effective are the scanning matrices of T'au voidships that they can detect and illuminate a single infantry target, even from orbit.

Once per turning point, when a friendly PATHFINDER operative performs the Markerlight action, you can use this rule. If you do, you can select one enemy operative in the killzone to gain one of your Markerlight tokens instead (it doesn't need to be visible). This isn't cumulative with the High-intensity Markerlight or Analyse rules.
