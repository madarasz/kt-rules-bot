## KILL TEAM COMPOSITION

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of 1 **PATHFINDER SHAS'UI** operative and 11 **PATHFINDER** operatives selected from the following list:
- **ASSAULT GRENADIER**
- **BLOODED**
- **COMMS SPECIALIST**
- **DRONE CONTROLLER**

### Archetypes

- **RECON**

## FACTION RULES

### MARKERLIGHTS
Some **PATHFINDER** operatives (indicated on their datacard) can perform the **Markerlight** unique action:

**MARKERLIGHT 1AP**
Select one enemy operative visible to this operative. That enemy operative gains one of your Markerlight tokens (to a maximum of four). An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

If an operative (excluding **MB3 RECON**) would perform the **Shoot** action (excluding **Guard**) and this action during the same activation, only the target of that **Shoot** action can be selected for this action (and vice versa).

Once during each of their activations, whenever an enemy operative that has any of your Markerlight tokens performs the **Dash**, **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, remove one of those tokens.

While only some **PATHFINDER** operatives can perform the **Markerlight** action, all **PATHFINDER** operatives can benefit from its effects. Whenever a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative is shooting with a weapon from its datacard (excluding **ASSAULT GRENADIER’s** fusion grenade), it has additional rules determined by the number of your Markerlight tokens the target has. These are cumulative.

| TOKENS | MARKERLIGHT ADDITIONAL RULES |
|---|---|
| **1** | **Saturate** and **Balanced** weapon rules. |
| **2** | Improve the Hit stat of that friendly operative's ranged weapons by 1 (to a maximum of 3+). |
| **3** | The target cannot be obscured. |
| **4** | **Seek Light** weapon rule. |

**Abilities:**
- **Medic!:** The first time during each turning point that another friendly **PATHFINDER** operative (excluding **DRONE**) would be **incapacitated** while visible to and within 3" of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within control range of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn’t **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within this operative's control range. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is **incapacitated**, or if it's a **Shoot** action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.

## STRATEGY PLOYS

### RECON SWEEP
Select one killzone edge (excluding your own). Each friendly **PATHFINDER** operative that's wholly within 6" of that edge can immediately perform a free **Dash** action in an order of your choice, but each that does so must end that move wholly within 6" of a killzone edge (excluding your own). You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

### SUPPRESSING FIRE
Whenever an enemy operative is performing the **Shoot** action, if the target (the primary target if the weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rules) isn't the closest valid target, your opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice. Ignore friendly **PATHFINDER** operatives that have a **Conceal** order or are obscured when determining this.

### BONDED
Whenever a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative (excluding **DRONE**) is shooting or retaliating with a ranged weapon (see **Point-Blank Fusillade** firefight ploy), if it's within 3" of another friendly **PATHFINDER** operative (excluding **DRONE**), that first friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule.

### TAKE COVER
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative, if you can retain any cover saves, improve that friendly operative's Save stat by 1.

## FIREFIGHT PLOYS

### A WORTHY CAUSE
Use this firefight ploy at the start of the Firefight phase. One friendly **PATHFINDER** operative (excluding **DRONE**) can immediately perform a free mission action.

### SUPPORTING FIRE
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you're selecting a valid target within 6" of it. Having other friendly **PATHFINDER** operatives within an enemy operative's control range doesn't prevent that enemy operative from being selected.

### SAVIOUR PROTOCOLS
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative (excluding **DRONE**) is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action. Select one friendly **PATHFINDER DRONE** operative visible to and within 3" of that first friendly operative to become the valid target instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). That friendly **DRONE** operative is only in cover or obscured if the original target was. This ploy has no effect if the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

### POINT-BLANK FUSILLADE
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative (excluding **DRONE**) is retaliating, if it wasn't within control range of enemy operatives at the start of that activation/counteraction. You can use one of its ranged weapons as a melee weapon (excluding a weapon that has the word ‘grenade’ in its name) during that sequence. If you do, you cannot block during that sequence, and the following weapon rules have no effect on its weapons until the end of that sequence: **Devastating**, **Piercing**, **Torrent**. If that friendly operative is ready, has an **Engage** order and is retaliating with a **pulse weapon**, you resolve the first attack dice (i.e. defender instead of attacker).

## FACTION EQUIPMENT

### TARGET ANALYSIS OPTIC
Once per turning point, when a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative (excluding **DRONE**) is performing the **Shoot** action and you're selecting a valid target, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, if the target has at least one of your Markerlight tokens, it's treated as having one more. If the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule, only the primary target is affected.

### HIGH-INTENSITY MARKERLIGHT
Once per turning point, when a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative (excluding **MV7 MARKER DRONE**) performs the **Markerlight** action, you can use this rule. If you do, the enemy operative you select gains two of your Markerlight tokens (instead of one).

### PHOTON GRENADE
Once per turning point, a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative that has the **Markerlight** action on their datacard (excluding **DRONE**) can perform the following unique action:

**PHOTON GRENADE 1AP**
Select a valid target for this operative and roll one D6: on a 3+, until the end of that operative's next activation, subtract 2" from its Move stat and it cannot perform the **Dash** action. An operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

### ORBITAL SURVEY UPLINK
Once per turning point, when a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative performs the **Markerlight** action, you can use this rule. If you do, you can select one enemy operative in the killzone to gain one of your Markerlight tokens instead (it doesn't need to be visible). This isn't cumulative with the **High-intensity Markerlight** or **Analyse** rules.
