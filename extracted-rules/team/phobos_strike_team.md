# PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM FACTION RULES

## PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM - OMNI-SCRAMBLER
**STRATEGIC GAMBIT** if a friendly **INFILTRATOR** operative is in the killzone. Select one enemy operative visible to a friendly **INFILTRATOR** operative, or within 6" of a friendly **VOXBREAKER** operative. In the following Firefight phase, that enemy operative cannot be activated or perform actions until one of the following is true:
- Your opponent has activated a number of enemy operatives equal to the number of friendly **INFILTRATOR** operatives in the killzone when this **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** was used.
- It's the last enemy operative to be activated.

## PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM - TERROR
Whenever an enemy operative is within 3" of friendly **REIVER** operatives, your opponent must spend 1 additional AP for that enemy operative to perform the **Pick Up Marker** and mission actions.

Whenever determining control of a marker, treat the total APL stat of enemy operatives that contest it as 1 lower if at least one of those enemy operatives is within 3" of friendly **REIVER** operatives. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

## PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM - ASTARTES
During each friendly **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions, a bolt weapon must be selected for at least one of them. A bolt weapon is any ranged weapon that includes 'bolt' in its name, e.g. marksman bolt carbine, special issue bolt pistol, etc.

Each friendly **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM** operative can counteract regardless of its order.

## PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM - MULTI-SPECTRUM ARRAY
Whenever a friendly **INCURSOR** operative is shooting, enemy operatives cannot be obscured.

Friendly **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM** operatives can perform the following unique action:
**GUERRILLA WARFARE [1AP]**

## PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM - AND THEY SHALL KNOW NO FEAR
You can ignore any changes to the stats of friendly **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM** operatives from being injured (including their weapons' stats).

## PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM - DEADLY SHOTS
Whenever a friendly **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM** operative is shooting during an activation in which it hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, or against an operative that isn't in cover and is more than 6" from it, that friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule. Note that for the first requirement, that operative isn't restricted from performing those actions after shooting.

## PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM - LETHAL ASSAULTS
Whenever a friendly **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM** operative is fighting, its melee weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule. If that friendly operative is doing so during an activation in which it performed the **Charge** action, its melee weapons also have the **Lethal 5+** weapon rule.

# PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM - PATIENT AMBUSH
Use this firefight ploy when it's your turn to activate a friendly operative. You can skip that activation.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM** operative that has a **Conceal** order is activated, is given an **Engage** order, performs the **Charge** and then the **Fight** action, and you're resolving your first attack dice from this activation. After doing so, you can immediately resolve another of your attack dice (before your opponent). The operative cannot have performed any other actions during this activation (but can do so after resolving this ploy).

# PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM FACTION EQUIPMENT

## PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM - PURITY SEALS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **PHOBOS STRIKE TEAM** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, if you roll two or more fails, you can discard one of them to retain another as a normal success instead.
