# Phobos Strike Team Faction Rules

## Phobos Strike Team - Omni-Scrambler
**Strategic Gambit** if a friendly **Infiltrator** operative is in the killzone. Select one enemy operative visible to a friendly **Infiltrator** operative, or within 6" of a friendly **Voxbreaker** operative. In the following Firefight phase, that enemy operative cannot be activated or perform actions until one of the following is true:
- Your opponent has activated a number of enemy operatives equal to the number of friendly **Infiltrator** operatives in the killzone when this **Strategic Gambit** was used.
- It's the last enemy operative to be activated.

## Phobos Strike Team - Terror
Whenever an enemy operative is within 3" of friendly **Reiver** operatives, your opponent must spend 1 additional AP for that enemy operative to perform the **Pick Up Marker** and mission actions.

Whenever determining control of a marker, treat the total APL stat of enemy operatives that contest it as 1 lower if at least one of those enemy operatives is within 3" of friendly **Reiver** operatives. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

## Phobos Strike Team - Astartes
During each friendly **Phobos Strike Team** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions, a bolt weapon must be selected for at least one of them. A bolt weapon is any ranged weapon that includes 'bolt' in its name, e.g. marksman bolt carbine, special issue bolt pistol, etc.

Each friendly **Phobos Strike Team** operative can counteract regardless of its order.

## Phobos Strike Team - Multi-Spectrum Array
Whenever a friendly **Incursor** operative is shooting, enemy operatives cannot be obscured.
