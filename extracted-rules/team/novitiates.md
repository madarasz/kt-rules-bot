## NOVITIATES - Faction Rule - ACTS OF FAITH
Such is the zeal of the Adepta Sororitas that in their presence the Emperor's divine will is made manifest.

In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, you gain a number of Faith points equal to half the number of friendly **NOVITIATE** operatives that haven't been **incapacitated** (rounding up). Whenever a friendly **NOVITIATE** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, or an operative is shooting it, in the Roll Attack Dice (or Roll Defence Dice step if an operative is shooting it), you can spend your Faith points to use one **ACT OF FAITH**. You cannot use more than one **ACT OF FAITH** per sequence, and their costs and effects are as follows:

### NOVITIATES - Faction Rule - ACTS OF FAITH - GUIDANCE
**1 FAITH POINT:** You can re-roll one of your dice.

### NOVITIATES - Faction Rule - ACTS OF FAITH - BLESSING
**2 FAITH POINTS:** You can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

### NOVITIATES - Faction Rule - ACTS OF FAITH - INTERVENTION
**3 FAITH POINTS:** You can retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it.

After that action, that friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within this operative's control range. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends.

### NOVITIATES - Operatives - NOVITIATE RELIQUARIUS - Icon Bearer
Whenever determining control of a marker, treat this operative's APL stat as 1 higher. Note this isn't a change to its APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

### NOVITIATES - Operatives - NOVITIATE RELIQUARIUS - RAISE ICON
**1AP:** You gain 1 Faith point. If this operative controls an objective marker, you also gain a number of Faith points equal to the turning point number.

## NOVITIATES - Strategy Ploy - ARDENT VENGEANCE
Whenever a friendly **NOVITIATE** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an expended enemy operative, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Punishing** weapon rule.

## NOVITIATES - Strategy Ploy - DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH
Whenever an operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a friendly **NOVITIATE** operative that contests an objective marker, in the Resolve Attack Dice step of that sequence, you can halve the damage inflicted (rounding up and to a minimum of 2) on that friendly operative from one normal success.

## NOVITIATES - Strategy Ploy - BLESSED REJUVENATION
Whenever you spend Faith points, at the end of that action, the friendly operative you spent them on can regain up to D3 lost wounds. Note this ploy has no effect if that friendly operative was **incapacitated** during that action, or if the **ACT OF FAITH** doesn't cost any Faith points, e.g. **Auto-chastisers** equipment.

## NOVITIATES - Strategy Ploy - RIGHTEOUS ADVANCE
Up to one third of the friendly **NOVITIATE** operatives in the killzone (rounding down, to a minimum of 1) can immediately perform a free **Dash** action in an order of your choice, but each that does so must end that move closer to its closest enemy operative, its closest objective marker or your opponent's drop zone (you can choose separately for each). You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

## NOVITIATES - Firefight Ploy - GLORIOUS MARTYRDOM
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **NOVITIATE** operative is **incapacitated**, before it's removed from the killzone. For each enemy operative **visible** to and within 2" of it, you gain 1 Faith point and inflict D3 damage on that enemy operative (roll separately for each).

## NOVITIATES - Firefight Ploy - BLAZING INFERNO
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **NOVITIATE** operative is shooting with a Ministorum flamer and you inflict damage with any critical successes. The target gains one of your Blaze tokens (if it doesn't already have one). Whenever an operative that has one of your Blaze tokens is activated:
- Inflict D3 damage on it.

## NOVITIATES - Firefight Ploy - BLINDING AURA
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative is performing the **Shoot** action and selects a friendly **NOVITIATE** operative as the valid target. Until the end of that activation/counteraction, while that friendly operative is more than 2" from that enemy operative, your opponent cannot select it as a valid target. If there are no other valid targets that your opponent can select, that action ends (it's not cancelled, so that operative has still performed it). Note this ploy has no effect if it's not the selected operative, e.g. if it's a secondary target from the **Blast** weapon rule.

## NOVITIATES - Firefight Ploy - GUIDED BY FAITH
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **NOVITIATE** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you're selecting a ranged weapon. Until the end of that action, whenever that operative is shooting an operative within 6" of it, that weapon has the **Seek Light** weapon rule.

## NOVITIATES - Faction Equipment - ICON OF FAITH
Once per turning point, you can use up to two **ACTS OF FAITH** during a sequence, but each one must be different. This takes precedence over the normal **ACTS OF FAITH** rules.

## NOVITIATES - Faction Equipment - SANCTIFIED ROUNDS
Whenever a friendly **NOVITIATE** operative is shooting with an autogun, autopistol, relic bolt pistol or relic boltgun, if you spend a Faith point, that weapon has the **Piercing Crits 1** weapon rule until the end of that sequence.

## NOVITIATES - Faction Equipment - AUTO-CHASTISERS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **NOVITIATE** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, in the Roll Attack Dice step, you can inflict 1-3 damage on that friendly operative (but not enough to **incapacitate** it). If you do, you can use one **ACT OF FAITH** for free during that sequence with a Faith points cost no more than the damage you inflicted from this rule.

## NOVITIATES - Faction Equipment - HOLY EMBROCATIONS
You can ignore any changes to the Move stat of friendly **NOVITIATE** operatives from being injured.
