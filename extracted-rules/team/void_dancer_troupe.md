# Void-Dancer Troupe Faction Rules

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Saedath
Void-dancer Troupes put on a performance as they attack from the Webway. A single player begins in the pivotal role, then the rest of the troupe progressively join in.

As a Strategic Gambit in the first turning point, you must select an Allegory (Epic or Melodrama below) for your kill team for the battle, and one friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative to have the Pivotal Role for the battle. Whenever a friendly operative has the Pivotal Role, it has the Accolade rule of your Allegory for the battle.

As a Strategic Gambit in each subsequent turning point, you can select one friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative to gain the Accolade rule of your Allegory for the battle.

Once per turning point, when a friendly operative that has the Pivotal Role completes the performance of your Allegory, you can select one friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative to gain the Accolade rule of your Allegory for the battle.

**Epic**
- **Performance:** The operative incapacitates an enemy operative while fighting.
- **Accolade:** Whenever this operative is fighting, its melee weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.

**Melodrama**
- **Performance:** The operative incapacitates an enemy operative while shooting.
- **Accolade:** The operative's ranged weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Harlequin's Panoply
The tools of the Harlequins' trade afford them additional mobility and make them highly difficult to target, enabling them to dodge away from piercing shots of plasma and melta fire.

- Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative, ignore the **Piercing** weapon rule.
- Whenever a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative is climbing up, you can treat the vertical distance as 2" (regardless of how far the operative actually moves vertically).
- Friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operatives can move within control range of enemy operatives (they must still start and end the move following all requirements for that move).

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Death Jester

At the end of that enemy operative's next activation, remove its Humbling Cruelty token.

- Save: 4+
- Wounds: 9

**Abilities:**
- **Fog of Dreams [1AP]:** Psychic. Select one ready enemy operative visible to this operative and roll one D6. Until the end of the turning point, that enemy operative cannot be activated or perform actions until it's the last enemy operative to be activated, or until your opponent has activated a number of enemy operatives after this action equal to the result of the D6 (whichever comes first). This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.
- **Mirror of Minds [1AP]:** Psychic. Select one enemy operative that's a valid target for and within 8" of this operative. Both players roll five D6. Pair your dice with your opponent's dice based on matching results. For each matching pair, inflict D3 damage on that enemy operative (to a maximum of 8). For example, if you rolled 6, 5, 5, 2, 1 and your opponent rolled 6, 5, 4, 3, 1, you would inflict 3D3 damage on that enemy operative. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

# Void-Dancer Troupe Strategy Ploys

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Darting Salvo
Whenever a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative performs the **Reposition** action during its activation, it can perform the **Shoot** action during that action (it must do so in a location it can be placed, and any remaining move distance it had from that **Reposition** action can be used after it does so).

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Rising Crescendo
Friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operatives can perform the **Dash** action during the same activation in which they performed the **Charge** action, but not vice versa (i.e. not **Dash** then **Charge**).

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Prismatic Blur
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative that performed an action in which it moved during this turning point, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Cegorach's Jest
Whenever a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative is fighting or retaliating and your opponent strikes with a normal success, you can roll one D6: if the result is less than the Hit stat of your opponent's selected weapon, that strike is a block instead (ignore the **Brutal** weapon rule, if relevant) and you cannot use this rule for the rest of the sequence.

# Void-Dancer Troupe Firefight Ploys

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Murderous Entrance
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative is fighting during an activation in which it performed the **Charge** action, after you strike. You can immediately resolve another of your normal successes as a strike (before your opponent), or one of your critical successes if there are none.

## Void-Dancer Troupe - The Curtain Falls
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative is fighting, after you strike with a critical success. End that sequence (any remaining attack dice are discarded) and immediately perform a free **Dash** or **Fall Back** action up to 3" with that operative (then the **Fight** action ends). That operative can do so even if it's performed an action that prevents it from performing the **Dash** or **Fall Back** action.

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Elusive Target
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative's activation. Until the start of its next activation, while that operative has a **Conceal** order and is in cover, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. **Seek**, Vantage terrain) except being within 2".

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Domino Field
Use this firefight ploy when an operative is shooting a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative, during the Resolve Defence Dice step. You can allocate one of your rolled successful dice to block all of your opponent's attack dice with matching results (e.g. one of your successful defence dice results of 5 can be used to block all successful attack dice results of 5).

# Void-Dancer Troupe Faction Equipment

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Wraithbone Talisman
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, if you roll two or more fails, you can discard one of them to retain another as a normal success instead.

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Shrieker Toxin Rounds
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a shuriken pistol or shrieker cannon (focused), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Devastating 1** weapon rule.

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Death Mask
Keep a Tragedy tally. Whenever a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative that has an Accolade rule is incapacitated, add 1 to your Tragedy tally. When your Tragedy tally reaches 3, you gain 1CP and stop that tally.

## Void-Dancer Troupe - Understudy's Mask
Once per battle, when you activate a friendly **Void-Dancer Troupe** operative, if the friendly operative that has the Pivotal Role has been incapacitated, you can use this rule. If you do, that activated operative has the Pivotal Role for the battle.
