# Scout Squad Faction Rules

## Scout Squad - Forward Scouting
At the end of the Set Up Operatives step, you can select and resolve up to six Forward Scouting options. Each option has a number in brackets, which is the maximum number of times you can select and resolve it for the battle. For example, your five selections could be Reposition (2), Trip Alarm (1), Booby Trap (1) and Diversion (1). If both players have this rule, alternate resolving selection by selection, starting with the player with initiative.

**Forward Scouting Options:**
- **Redeploy (1):** Change the set up of one third of your operatives (rounding up).
- **Reposition (2):** Perform a free **Reposition** action with one friendly operative that's wholly within your drop zone. It must end that move wholly within 3" of your drop zone.
- **Trip Alarm (2):** Place one of your Trip Alarm markers more than 6" from your opponent's drop zone. During the first and second turning point, whenever a friendly **Scout Squad** operative is shooting an enemy operative that's within 2" of that marker, that friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Seek** weapon rule. In the Ready step of the third Strategy phase, remove that marker.
- **Booby Trap (1):** Place one of your Booby Trap markers more than 6" from your opponent's drop zone and more than 2" from other markers, access points and Accessible terrain. The first time your Booby Trap marker is within an enemy operative's control range, remove that marker and inflict 2D3 damage on that operative; if it isn't incapacitated, end its action (if any), even if that action's effects aren't fulfilled. If it cannot be placed, move it the minimum amount to do so.
- **Tactical Manoeuvre (1):** Once per battle **Strategic Gambit**. Select one friendly operative. Until the end of that operative's next activation, add 1 to its APL stat.
- **Diversion (1):** Once per battle **Strategic Gambit**. Select one enemy operative within 6" of a killzone edge. Until the end of that operative's next activation, subtract 1 from its APL stat.
- **Devise Plan (1):** You gain 1CP.
- **Designate Target (1):** Select one enemy operative to gain one of your Target tokens. Whenever a friendly **Scout Squad** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an enemy operative that has one of your Target tokens, you can re-roll one of your attack dice.
- **Spy (1):** Approved Ops only. Your opponent must reveal their selected tac op.

# Scout Squad Strategy Ploys

## Scout Squad - Guerrilla Engagement
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting a friendly **Scout Squad** operative, if that friendly operative is in cover and more than 6" from enemy operatives it's visible to, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## Scout Squad - Gunfire Ambush
Whenever a friendly **Scout Squad** operative is shooting during its activation, if its order was changed from **Conceal** to **Engage** at the start of that activation, or it wasn't visible to enemy operatives at the start of that activation:
- That friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.
- If the target is expended, that friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule instead.

## Scout Squad - Blade Ambush
Whenever a friendly **Scout Squad** operative is fighting during its activation, if its order was changed from **Conceal** to **Engage** at the start of that activation, or it wasn't visible to enemy operatives at the start of that activation:
- That friendly operative's melee weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.
- If the target is expended, that friendly operative's melee weapons also have the **Rending** weapon rule.

## Scout Squad - Stealth Relocation
Select one friendly **Scout Squad** operative more than 6" from enemy operatives. That friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action and/or you can change its order. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

# Scout Squad Firefight Ploys

## Scout Squad - Astartes Training
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Scout Squad** operative's activation. Until the end of that activation, that operative can either perform two **Fight** actions, or two **Shoot** actions if an Astartes shotgun, bolt pistol or boltgun is selected for at least one of them.

## Scout Squad - Raw Physiology
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Scout Squad** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action. Until the start of its next activation, you can ignore any changes to that operative's stats from being injured (including its weapons' stats).

## Scout Squad - Emboldened Aspirant
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Scout Squad** operative performs the **Shoot** or **Fight** action, at the end of the Roll Attack Dice step after any re-rolls. If it's the first friendly operative to perform either of those actions during this turning point, or if the enemy operative in that action (primary target, if relevant) has a higher Wounds stat than that friendly **Scout Squad** operative, you can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## Scout Squad - Covert Position
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Scout Squad** operative's activation. Until the start of its next activation, while that operative has a **Conceal** order and is in cover, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. **Seek**, Vantage terrain) except being within 2".

# Scout Squad Faction Equipment

## Scout Squad - Camo Cloak
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Scout Squad** operative (excluding **Sniper**), if you can retain any cover saves, you can retain one additional cover save. This isn't cumulative with improved cover saves from Vantage terrain.

## Scout Squad - Targeting Oculars
Up to twice per turning point, when a friendly **Scout Squad** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you're selecting a valid target, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, that friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Lethal** 5+ and **Saturate** weapon rules.

## Scout Squad - Combat Blade
Friendly **Scout Squad** operatives have the following melee weapon. Note that some operatives already have this weapon but with better stats; in that instance, use the better version.
| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG |
|---|---|---|---|
| Combat blade | 3 | 3+ | 4/5 |

## Scout Squad - Heavy Weapon Bipod
Whenever a friendly **Scout Squad Heavy Gunner** operative is shooting with a heavy bolter or missile launcher, if it hasn't moved during the activation, or if it's a counteraction, that weapon has the **Ceaseless** weapon rule; if the weapon already has that weapon rule, it has the **Relentless** weapon rule. Note that operative isn't restricted from moving after shooting.
