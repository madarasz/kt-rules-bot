## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Operative Selection
An **INQUISITORIAL AGENTS** kill team includes one **INTERROGATOR AGENT** operative and one **TOME-SKULL** operative. It also includes either:
*   5 **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operatives selected from the following list:
    *   **AUTOSAVANT**
    *   **QUESTKEEPER**
    *   **DEATH WORLD VETERAN**
    *   **ENLIGHTENER**
    *   **HEXORCIST**
    *   **MYSTIC**
    *   **PENAL LEGIONNAIRE**
    *   **PISTOLIER**
    *   **GUN SERVITOR** with one of the following options:
        *   Heavy bolter; servo claw
        *   Multi-melta; servo claw
        *   Plasma cannon; servo claw
*   **REQUISITIONED** operatives from one group in the Inquisitorial Requisition faction rule (you cannot select **REQUISITIONED** operatives from different groups).

Your kill team can only include each operative on this list once, unless you're not including any **REQUISITIONED** operatives, in which case you can include up to two **GUN SERVITOR** operatives, but each one must have different options. Your kill team (including any **REQUISITIONED** operatives) cannot include more than one weapon with the **Piercing 2** weapon rule, and cannot include more than three weapons with the **Piercing X** (excluding **Piercing Crits X**) weapon rule combined.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Archetypes
- ANY

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Faction Rule - INQUISITORIAL REQUISITION
Few authorities in the Imperium have greater jurisdiction than the Inquisition. An Inquisitor can, on a whim, requisition forces from virtually any of the Imperium's military branches.

**REQUISITIONED** operatives can be taken from one of the following groups to supplement an **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** kill team, as specified in this kill team's selection rules:
*   **DEATH KORPS**
*   **EXACTION SQUAD**
*   **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER**
*   **KASRKIN**
*   **SISTER OF SILENCE**
*   **TEMPESTUS SCION**

These operatives have their faction keyword replaced in all instances on their datacards with **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** (unless they already have it). You cannot use ploys and equipment associated with a **REQUISITIONED** operative's former faction keyword, and you cannot use a **REQUISITIONED** operative's former faction rules unless specified on their Inquisitorial Requisition card (it only applies to those **REQUISITIONED** operatives). Note that with their new faction keyword, **REQUISITIONED** operatives can interact with the **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** rules.

For example, a **REQUISITIONED VOX-OPERATOR** operative from the **DEATH KORPS** group would have its **DEATH KORPS** keyword replaced in all instances on its datacard with **INQUISITORIAL AGENT**. This allows you to select any other friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative for its Signal unique action. However, the Guardsman Orders faction rule isn't permitted, so its Relay Orders additional rule would be ignored. It would now also be a valid operative for the **INQUISITORIAL AGENT MYSTIC** operative's Scry unique action.

6 **DEATH KORPS** operatives selected from the following list:

    *   Plasma gun; gun butt

Other than **ARMSMAN** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. Your kill team can only include a **GHEISTSKULL** operative if it also includes a **VOID-JAMMER** operative, and it can only include a **C.A.T. UNIT** operative if it also includes a **SURVEYOR** operative. **C.A.T.

### INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Operatives - TEMPESTUS SCION VOX-OPERATOR - SIGNAL
**1AP:** **SUPPORT**. Select one other friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative in the killzone. Until the end of that operative's next activation, add 1 to its APL stat. This operative can perform this action twice during its activation, but cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Strategy Ploy - DENOUNCE
Select one enemy operative and roll one D3. In the Firefight phase of this turning point, that enemy operative cannot be activated or perform actions until it's the last enemy operative to be activated, or your opponent has activated a number of enemy operatives equal to the result of the D3 (whichever comes first). This ploy costs you 1 additional CP for each previous time you've used it during the battle (e.g. 1CP the first time you would use it, 2CP the second time, etc.).

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Strategy Ploy - INTENSE SCRUTINY
Whenever you're selecting a valid target for a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative, enemy operatives **wholly within 4"** of it cannot be **in cover** (instead of 2"). While this can allow such operatives to be targeted (assuming they're **visible**), it doesn't remove their cover save (if any), unless the friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative is **wholly within 2"** as normal.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Strategy Ploy - QUARRY
Select one enemy operative to be your quarry for the turning point. Whenever a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against your quarry, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule. Whenever your quarry is **incapacitated**, you can select a new enemy operative to be your quarry (and can continue to do so during this turning point).

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Strategy Ploy - IRREFUTABLE JURISDICTION
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative that's **wholly within 3"** of an objective marker, you can re-roll one of your defence dice. If that friendly operative contests that marker, you can re-roll any of your defence dice results of one result instead (e.g. results of 2).

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Firefight Ploy - ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY
Use this firefight ploy during the battle, when an opponent uses a strategy or firefight ploy (excluding Command Re-roll or one that costs 0CP). Their ploy isn't used, the CP spent on it is refunded and they cannot use that ploy again during this turning point. This ploy cannot be used to stop the same ploy more than once per battle.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Firefight Ploy - RELENTLESS IN PURSUIT
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative **wholly within 2"** of a ready friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative performs an action in which it moves. After it moves, that friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative can either perform a free **Reposition** action, but must end that move **wholly within 2"** of that enemy operative, or a free **Charge** action, but must end that move within **control range** of that enemy operative. If neither is possible, that friendly operative cannot perform those actions, this ploy isn't used and the CP spent on it is refunded.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Firefight Ploy - THE EMPEROR'S WILL
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative is activated. Until the end of that operative's activation, you can ignore any changes to its stats (including its weapons' stats).

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Firefight Ploy - INTIMIDATING PRESENCE
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative **visible** to and **wholly within 3"** of a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative, or **visible** to and **wholly within 6"** of a friendly **MYSTIC** operative, performs the **Pick Up Marker** or a mission action (excluding **Operate Hatch**). Your opponent must spend 1 additional AP for that enemy operative to perform that action (if they cannot or choose not to, the AP spent on it is refunded).

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Faction Equipment - INQUISITORIAL ROSETTE
Once per battle, when a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative is activated, if you've used the **Quarry** strategy ploy during this turning point, you can use this rule. If you do, you can select a new enemy operative to be your quarry until the end of the turning point.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Faction Equipment - COMBAT DAGGERS

**NAME:** Combat dagger

**DMG:** 3/4

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Faction Equipment - ARMOURED BODYSUITS
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative (excluding **TOME-SKULL**) that has a 5+ Save stat, you can retain one of your defence dice results of 4 as a normal success.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - Rules Commentaries
[FAQ]
***Question***: If I requisition **EXACTION SQUAD** operatives, can my other **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operatives benefit from the permitted Ruthless Efficiency faction rule?
***Answer***: **No. Only the requisitioned EXACTION SQUAD operatives can use the Ruthless Efficiency faction rule. Note that this means a requisitioned EXACTION SQUAD operative will not be able to select an enemy operative as the valid target of a Shoot action if one of your other INQUISITORIAL AGENT operatives that aren't EXACTION SQUAD are within that enemy operative's control range.**

[FAQ]
***Question***: When using the **Absolute Authority** firefight ploy, can I use it after seeing some of the effects of a ploy the opponent uses? For example, if they must select an operative, can I use it after they select them?
***Answer***: **No. You must use it when the ploy is declared, but before any of its rules are resolved. Note that we expect players to be sporting and give their opponent the opportunity to use Absolute Authority when they declare a ploy, before resolving its rules.**
