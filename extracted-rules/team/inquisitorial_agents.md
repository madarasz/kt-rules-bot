    *   **ENLIGHTENER**
    *   **HEXORCIST**

Your kill team (including any **REQUISITIONED** operatives) cannot include more than one weapon with the **Piercing 2** weapon rule, and cannot include more than three weapons with the **Piercing X** (excluding **Piercing Crits X**) weapon rule combined.

# INQUISITORIAL AGENTS FACTION RULES

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - INQUISITORIAL REQUISITION
Few authorities in the Imperium have greater jurisdiction than the Inquisition. An Inquisitor can, on a whim, requisition forces from virtually any of the Imperium's military branches.

**REQUISITIONED** operatives can be taken from one of the following groups to supplement an **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** kill team, as specified in this kill team's selection rules:
*   **DEATH KORPS**
*   **EXACTION SQUAD**
*   **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER**
*   **KASRKIN**
*   **SISTER OF SILENCE**
*   **TEMPESTUS SCION**

These operatives have their faction keyword replaced in all instances on their datacards with **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** (unless they already have it). You cannot use ploys and equipment associated with a **REQUISITIONED** operative's former faction keyword, and you cannot use a **REQUISITIONED** operative's former faction rules unless specified on their Inquisitorial Requisition card (it only applies to those **REQUISITIONED** operatives). Note that with their new faction keyword, **REQUISITIONED** operatives can interact with the **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** rules.

For example, a **REQUISITIONED VOX-OPERATOR** operative from the **DEATH KORPS** group would have its **DEATH KORPS** keyword replaced in all instances on its datacard with **INQUISITORIAL AGENT**. This allows you to select any other friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative for its **Signal** unique action. However, the Guardsman Orders faction rule isn't permitted, so its Relay Orders additional rule would be ignored. It would now also be a valid operative for the **INQUISITORIAL AGENT MYSTIC** operative's **Scry** unique action.

### DEATH KORPS
6 **DEATH KORPS** operatives selected from the following list:
*   **BRUISER**
*   **CONFIDANT** with one of the following options:
    *   Boltgun or lasgun; bayonet
    *   Bolt pistol or relic laspistol; chainsword
*   **GUNNER** with flamer and bayonet*
*   **GUNNER** with grenade launcher and bayonet*
*   **GUNNER** with meltagun and bayonet*
*   **GUNNER** with plasma gun and bayonet*
*   **MEDIC**
*   **SAPPER**
*   **SNIPER***
*   **TROOPER**
*   **VETERAN**
*   **VOX-OPERATOR**
*   **ZEALOT**

Other than **TROOPER** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once.
*You cannot select more than three of these operatives combined.

### EXACTION SQUAD
5 **EXACTION SQUAD** operatives selected from the following list:
*   **CASTIGATOR**
*   **CHIRURGANT**
*   **GUNNER** with one of the following options:
    *   Grenade launcher; repression baton

    *   Webber; repression baton
*   **LEASHMASTER**
*   **MALOCATOR**
*   **MARKSMAN**

*   **GUNNER** with one of the following options:
    *   Navis las-volley; gun butt
    *   Meltagun; gun butt
    *   Plasma gun; gun butt

Other than **ARMSMAN** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. Your kill team can only include a **GHEISTSKULL** operative if it also includes a **VOID-JAMMER** operative, and it can only include a **C.A.T. UNIT** operative if it also includes a **SURVEYOR** operative.
*These operatives count as half a selection each, meaning you can select both of them and it's treated as one selection in total.
Permitted **IMPERIAL NAVY BREACHER** faction rule: Void Armour.

### KASRKIN
5 **KASRKIN** operatives selected from the following list:
*   **COMBAT MEDIC**

**Abilities:**
- **Medic!:** The first time during each turning point that another friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative would be **incapacitated** while visible to and within 3" of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within control range of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn't **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can then immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within this operative's control range. Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is **incapacitated**, or if it's a **Shoot** action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.

# INQUISITORIAL AGENTS STRATEGY PLOYS

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - DENOUNCE
Select one enemy operative and roll one D3. In the Firefight phase of this turning point, that enemy operative cannot be activated or perform actions until it's the last enemy operative to be activated, or your opponent has activated a number of enemy operatives equal to the result of the D3 (whichever comes first). This ploy costs you 1 additional CP for each previous time you've used it during the battle (e.g. 1CP the first time you would use it, 2CP the second time, etc.).

Whenever you're selecting a valid target for a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative, enemy operatives within 4" of it cannot be in cover (instead of 2"). While this can allow such operatives to be targeted (assuming they're visible), it doesn't remove their cover save (if any), unless the friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative is within 2" as normal.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - QUARRY
Select one enemy operative to be your quarry for the turning point. Whenever a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against your quarry, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule. Whenever your quarry is incapacitated, you can select a new enemy operative to be your quarry (and can continue to do so during this turning point).

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - IRREFUTABLE JURISDICTION
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative that's within 3" of an objective marker, you can re-roll one of your defence dice. If that friendly operative contests that marker, you can re-roll any of your defence dice results of one result instead (e.g. results of 2).

# INQUISITORIAL AGENTS FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY
Use this firefight ploy during the battle, when an opponent uses a strategy or firefight ploy (excluding Command Re-roll or one that costs 0CP). Their ploy isn't used, the CP spent on it is refunded and they cannot use that ploy again during this turning point. This ploy cannot be used to stop the same ploy more than once per battle.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - RELENTLESS IN PURSUIT
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative within 2" of a ready friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative performs an action in which it moves. After it moves, that friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative can either perform a free **Reposition** action, but must end that move within 2" of that enemy operative, or a free **Charge** action, but must end that move within control range of that enemy operative. If neither is possible, that friendly operative cannot perform those actions, this ploy isn't used and the CP spent on it is refunded.

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - THE EMPEROR'S WILL
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative is activated. Until the end of that operative's activation, you can ignore any changes to its stats (including its weapons' stats).

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - INTIMIDATING PRESENCE
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative visible to and within 3" of a friendly **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operative, or visible to and within 6" of a friendly **MYSTIC** operative, performs the **Pick Up Marker** or a mission action (excluding **Operate Hatch**). Your opponent must spend 1 additional AP for that enemy operative to perform that action (if they cannot or choose not to, the AP spent on it is refunded).

## INQUISITORIAL AGENTS - ARMOURED BODYSUITS

# INQUISITORIAL AGENTS RULES COMMENTARIES
[FAQ]
*Question*: If I requisition **EXACTION SQUAD** operatives, can my other **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operatives benefit from the permitted Ruthless Efficiency faction rule?
*Answer*: No. Only the requisitioned **EXACTION SQUAD** operatives can use the Ruthless Efficiency faction rule. Note that this means a requisitioned **EXACTION SQUAD** operative will not be able to select an enemy operative as the valid target of a **Shoot** action if one of your other **INQUISITORIAL AGENT** operatives that aren't **EXACTION SQUAD** are within that enemy operative's control range.

[FAQ]
*Question*: When using the **Absolute Authority** firefight ploy, can I use it after seeing some of the effects of a ploy the opponent uses? For example, if they must select an operative, can I use it after they select them?
*Answer*: No. You must use it when the ploy is declared, but before any of its rules are resolved. Note that we expect players to be sporting and give their opponent the opportunity to use **Absolute Authority** when they declare a ploy, before resolving its rules.

*Answer*: Yes.
