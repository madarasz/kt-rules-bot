# Inquisitorial Agents

## Inquisitorial Agents Composition

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of operatives selected from the following lists:

*   1 **Interrogator Agent** operative
*   1 **Tome-Skull** operative
*   5 **Inquisitorial Agent** operatives selected from the following list:
    *   **Autosavant**
    *   **Questkeeper**
    *   **Death World Veteran**
    *   **Enlightener**
    *   **Hexorcist**
    *   **Mystic**
    *   **Penal Legionnaire**
    *   **Pistolier**
    *   **Gun Servitor** with one of the following options:
        *   Heavy bolter; servo claw
        *   Multi-melta; servo claw
        *   Plasma cannon; servo claw

Alternatively, instead of the 5 **Inquisitorial Agent** operatives above, you can select 5 **Requisitioned** operatives from one group in the Inquisitorial Requisition faction rule (you cannot select **Requisitioned** operatives from different groups).

Your kill team can only include each operative on this list once, unless you're not including any **Requisitioned** operatives, in which case you can include up to two **Gun Servitor** operatives, but each one must have different options. Your kill team (including any **Requisitioned** operatives) cannot include more than one weapon with the **Piercing 2** weapon rule, and cannot include more than three weapons with the **Piercing X** (excluding **Piercing Crits X**) weapon rule combined.

# Inquisitorial Agents Faction Rules

## Inquisitorial Requisition
**Requisitioned** operatives can be taken from one of the following groups to supplement an **Inquisitorial Agent** kill team, as specified in this kill team's selection rules. These operatives have their faction keyword replaced in all instances on their datacards with **Inquisitorial Agent** (unless they already have it). You cannot use ploys and equipment associated with a **Requisitioned** operative's former faction keyword, and you cannot use a **Requisitioned** operative's former faction rules unless specified on their Inquisitorial Requisition card (it only applies to those **Requisitioned** operatives). Note that with their new faction keyword, **Requisitioned** operatives can interact with the **Inquisitorial Agent** rules.

For example, a **Requisitioned Vox-Operator** operative from the **Death Korps** group would have its **Death Korps** keyword replaced in all instances on its datacard with **Inquisitorial Agent**. This allows you to select any other friendly **Inquisitorial Agent** operative for its Signal unique action. However, the Guardsman Orders faction rule isn't permitted, so its Relay Orders additional rule would be ignored. It would now also be a valid operative for the **Inquisitorial Agent Mystic** operative's Scry unique action.

### Death Korps
6 **Death Korps** operatives selected from the following list:
*   **Bruiser**
*   **Confidant** with one of the following options:
    *   Boltgun or lasgun; bayonet
    *   Bolt pistol or relic laspistol; chainsword
*   **Gunner** with flamer and bayonet
*   **Gunner** with grenade launcher and bayonet
*   **Gunner** with meltagun and bayonet
*   **Gunner** with plasma gun and bayonet
*   **Medic**
*   **Sapper**
*   **Sniper**
*   **Trooper**
*   **Veteran**
*   **Vox-Operator**
*   **Zealot**

Other than **Trooper** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. You cannot select more than three of these operatives combined: **Gunner** with flamer and bayonet, **Gunner** with grenade launcher and bayonet, **Gunner** with meltagun and bayonet, **Gunner** with plasma gun and bayonet, **Sniper**.

### Exaction Squad
5 **Exaction Squad** operatives selected from the following list:
*   **Castigator**
*   **Chirurgant**
*   **Gunner** with one of the following options:
    *   Grenade launcher; repression baton
    *   Heavy stubber; repression baton
    *   Webber; repression baton
*   **Leashmaster**
*   **Malocator**
*   **Marksman**
*   **Revelatum**
*   **R-VR Cyber-Mastiff**
*   **Subductor**
*   **Vigilant**
*   **Vox-Signifier**

Other than **Subductor** and **Vigilant** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. Your kill team can only include up to two **Subductor** operatives.
Permitted **Exaction Squad** faction rules: Ruthless Efficiency, Repress.

### Imperial Navy Breachers
5 **Imperial Navy Breachers** operatives selected from the following list:
*   **Armsman**
*   **Axejack**
*   **C.A.T. Unit**
*   **Endurant**
*   **Gheistskull**
*   **Grenadier**
*   **Hatchcutter**
*   **Surveyor**
*   **Void-Jammer**
*   **Gunner** with one of the following options:
    *   Navis las-volley; gun butt
    *   Meltagun; gun butt
    *   Plasma gun; gun butt

Other than **Armsmen** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. Your kill team can only include a **Gheistskull** operative if it also includes a **Void-Jammer** operative, and it can only include a **C.A.T. Unit** operative if it also includes a **Surveyor** operative. **C.A.T. Unit** and **Gheistskull** operatives count as half a selection each, meaning you can select both of them and it's treated as one selection in total.
Permitted **Imperial Navy Breachers** faction rule: Void Armour.

### Kasrkin
5 **Kasrkin** operatives selected from the following list:
*   **Combat Medic**
*   **Demo-Trooper**

- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 5

**Weapons:**
*This operative has no weapons.*

**Abilities:**
- **Consecrated Tome:** This operative can have an Inquisitorial Tome rule (see **Interrogator**). Note it keeps that rule even if that friendly **Interrogator** operative is removed from the killzone. The first time this operative is incapacitated during the battle, you can set it up within control range of a friendly **Interrogator** operative in a location it can be placed, and select an Inquisitorial Tome rule for it to have. If you do, that **Interrogator** operative cannot then have an Inquisitorial Tome rule for the rest of the battle (although it can continue to change this operative's as normal).
- **Machine:**
    - This operative cannot perform any actions other than **Charge**, **Dash**, **Fall Back** and **Reposition**.
    - It cannot retaliate or assist in a fight.
    - Whenever determining control of a marker, treat this operative's APL stat as 1 lower. Note this isn't a change to its APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.
    - Whenever this operative has a **Conceal** order and is in cover, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. Seek, Vantage terrain) except being within 2".
- **Expendable:** This operative is ignored for your opponent's kill/elimination op (when it's incapacitated, and when determining your starting number of operatives). It's also ignored for victory conditions and scoring VPs if either require operatives to 'escape', 'survive' or be incapacitated by enemy operatives (if it escapes/survives/is incapacitated, determining how many operatives must escape/survive/be incapacitated, etc.).
- **Group Activation:** Whenever this operative is expended, you must then activate a ready friendly **Inquisitorial Agent Interrogator** operative (if able) before your opponent activates. The same is true in reverse (**Interrogator** followed by **Tome-Skull**). When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal.

# Inquisitorial Agents Strategy Ploys

## Inquisitorial Agents - Denounce
Select one enemy operative and roll one D3. In the Firefight phase of this turning point, that enemy operative cannot be activated or perform actions until it's the last enemy operative to be activated, or your opponent has activated a number of enemy operatives equal to the result of the D3 (whichever comes first). This ploy costs you 1 additional CP for each previous time you've used it during the battle (e.g. 1CP the first time you would use it, 2CP the second time, etc.).

## Inquisitorial Agents - Intense Scrutiny
Whenever you're selecting a valid target for a friendly **Inquisitorial Agent** operative, enemy operatives within 4" of it cannot be in cover (instead of 2"). While this can allow such operatives to be targeted (assuming they're visible), it doesn't remove their cover save (if any), unless the friendly **Inquisitorial Agent** operative is within 2" as normal.

## Inquisitorial Agents - Quarry
Select one enemy operative to be your quarry for the turning point. Whenever a friendly **Inquisitorial Agent** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against your quarry, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule. Whenever your quarry is incapacitated, you can select a new enemy operative to be your quarry (and can continue to do so during this turning point).

## Inquisitorial Agents - Irrefutable Jurisdiction
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Inquisitorial Agent** operative that's within 3" of an objective marker, you can re-roll one of your defence dice. If that friendly operative controls that marker, you can re-roll any of your defence dice results of one result instead (e.g. results of 2).

# Inquisitorial Agents Firefight Ploys

## Inquisitorial Agents - Absolute Authority
Use this firefight ploy during the battle, when an opponent uses a strategy or firefight ploy (excluding Command Re-roll or one that costs 0CP). Their ploy isn't used, the CP spent on it is refunded and they cannot use that ploy again during this turning point. This ploy cannot be used to stop the same ploy more than once per battle.

## Inquisitorial Agents - Relentless in Pursuit
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative within 6" of a friendly **Inquisitorial Agent** operative performs an action in which it moves. After it moves, that friendly **Inquisitorial Agent** operative can either perform a free **Reposition** action, but must end that move within 2" of that enemy operative, or a free **Charge** action, but must end that move within control range of that enemy operative. If neither is possible, or that friendly operative cannot perform those actions, this ploy isn't used and the CP spent on it is refunded.

## Inquisitorial Agents - The Emperor's Will
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Inquisitorial Agent** operative is activated. Until the end of that operative's activation, you can ignore any changes to its stats (including its weapons' stats).

Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative visible to and within 6" of a friendly **Inquisitorial Agent** operative, or visible to and within 6" of a friendly **Mystic** operative performing the **Pick Up** marker, is a mission action (excluding **Operate Hatch**). Your opponent must spend 1 additional AP for that enemy operative to perform that action (if they cannot or choose not to, the AP spent on it is refunded).

# Inquisitorial Agents Rules Commentaries
[FAQ]
*Question*: If I requisition **Exaction Squad** operatives, can my other **Inquisitorial Agent** operatives benefit from the permitted Ruthless Efficiency faction rule?
*Answer*: No. Only the requisitioned **Exaction Squad** operatives can use the Ruthless Efficiency faction rule. Note that this means a requisitioned **Exaction Squad** operative will not be able to select an enemy operative as the valid target of a **Shoot** action if one of your other **Inquisitorial Agent** operatives that aren't **Exaction Squad** are within that enemy operative's control range.

[FAQ]
*Question*: When using the Absolute Authority firefight ploy, can I use it after seeing some of the effects of a ploy the opponent uses? For example, if they must select an operative, can I use it after they select them?
*Answer*: No. You must use it when the ploy is declared, but before any of its rules are resolved. Note that we expect players to be sporting and give their opponent the opportunity to use Absolute Authority when they declare a ploy, before resolving its rules.

[FAQ]

*Answer*: Yes.
