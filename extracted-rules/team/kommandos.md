# KOMMANDOS

## KOMMANDOS COMPOSITION

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of 1 **KOMMANDO BOSS NOB** operative and 9 **KOMMANDO** operatives selected from the following list:
- **BOMB SQUIG***
- **BOY**
- **BREACHA BOY**
- **BURNA BOY**
- **COMMS BOY**
- **DAKKA BOY**
- **GROT***
- **ROKKIT BOY**
- **SLASHA BOY**
- **SNIPA BOY**

Other than **BOY** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once.

*These operatives count as half a selection each, meaning you can select both of them and it's treated as one selection in total.

The **KOMMANDO BOSS NOB** operative must be equipped with one of the following options:
- Slugga; big choppa
- Slugga; power klaw

### Archetypes
- INFILTRATION
- SEEK & DESTROY

# KOMMANDOS FACTION RULES

## THROAT SLITTAS
Unusual amongst Orks, Kommandos utilise stealth and misdirection to close in before falling upon the enemy with jagged blades drawn.

Each friendly **KOMMANDO** operative (excluding **BOMB SQUIG**) can perform the **Charge** action while it has a Conceal order.

# KOMMANDOS STRATEGY PLOYS

## KOMMANDOS - DAKKA! DAKKA! DAKKA!
Whilst they are more subtle than other Orks, Kommandos hold to the same belief that any target can be overcome by simply applying a greater volume of fire. Friendly **KOMMANDO** operatives' ranged weapons have the **Punishing** weapon rule.

## KOMMANDOS - WAAAGH!
The infamous and dreaded battle cry of the Orks heralds a tempest of violence and butchery. Friendly **KOMMANDO** operatives' melee weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.

## KOMMANDOS - SKULK ABOUT
Kommandos exploit cover and terrain to confound the enemy and confuse their aim. Whenever an enemy operative is shooting a friendly **KOMMANDO** operative that has a Conceal order, you can retain one of your defence dice as a normal success without rolling it (in addition to a cover save, if any).

## KOMMANDOS - SSSSHHHH!
Despite their colossal bulk, Ork Kommandos are capable of moving surprisingly quietly, should the situation demand it. Each friendly **KOMMANDO** operative that's not a valid target for enemy operatives, or has a Conceal order and is more than 6" from enemy operatives, can immediately perform a free **Dash** action. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

# KOMMANDOS FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## KOMMANDOS - JUST A SCRATCH
Orks have a remarkable ability to shrug off grievous damage that would incapacitate most other species. Use this firefight ploy when an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on a friendly **KOMMANDO** operative (excluding **BOMB SQUIG** and **GROT**). Ignore that inflicted damage.

## KOMMANDOS - KRUMP 'EM!
Whilst they are far more crafty than your average Ork, Kommandos are still ultimately driven by a need to fight and kill. Use this firefight ploy at the end of the Firefight phase. Select one friendly **KOMMANDO** operative. It can immediately perform a free **Fight** action.

## KOMMANDOS - KUNNIN' BUT BRUTAL
Whilst they may utilise stealth and cunning to get within range of their enemies, Kommandos are no less enthusiastic about meting out brutal violence. Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **KOMMANDO** operative that has a Conceal order is fighting during an activation in which it performed the **Charge** action, you're resolving the first attack dice, and it's a strike with a normal success. Treat that normal success as a critical success instead.

## KOMMANDOS - SHAKE IT OFF
Ork Kommandos bolster their natural resilience with makeshift armour and protective equipment, rendering their advance almost impossible to slow. Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **KOMMANDO** operative is activated, or when its APL stat is changed. Until the start of the next turning point, you can ignore any changes to its APL stat.

# KOMMANDOS FACTION EQUIPMENT

## KOMMANDOS - CHOPPAS
Ork blades may appear crude and rusty, but this is of little comfort to those on the receiving end of a choppa blow. Friendly **KOMMANDO** operatives (excluding **BOMB SQUIG** and **GROT**) have the following melee weapon. Note that some operatives already have this weapon but with better stats; in that instance, use the better version.
| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG |
|---|---|---|---|
| Choppa | 3 | 3+ | 4/5 |

## KOMMANDOS - DYNAMITE
Kommandos are known to utilise a variety of improvised explosives, the most common of which are bundles of volatile dynamite. Once per battle, a friendly **KOMMANDO** operative (excluding **BOMB SQUIG** and **GROT**) can use the following ranged weapon:
| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dynamite | 5 | 4+ | 4/5 | Range 4", Blast 1", Heavy (Reposition only), Saturate |

## KOMMANDOS - HARPOON
This weapon fires a sharp, barbed projectile that snags any foes it doesn't kill outright, preventing them from moving. Once per turning point, a friendly **KOMMANDO** operative (excluding **BOMB SQUIG** and **GROT**) can use the following ranged weapon:
| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Harpoon | 4 | 4+ | 4/5 | Range 8", Lethal 5+, Stun |

## KOMMANDOS - COLLAPSIBLE STOCKS
Kommandos often use modified guns with cut down or folding shoulder stocks to enhance the impact of their firepower. Add 4" to the Range weapon rule of the following ranged weapons that friendly **KOMMANDO** operatives have:
- Dakka shoota (short range)
- Shokka pistol
- Slugga

# KOMMANDOS RULES COMMENTARY
[FAQ]
*Question:* If a **KOMMANDO BOMB SQUIG** is incapacitated during a **Door Fight** or **Hatchway Fight** action, is the other operative in that action a secondary target for a **Shoot** action caused by the **Boom!** rule?
*Answer:* No.
