### Archetypes
- SECURITY
- SEEK & DESTROY

# SANCTIFIERS FACTION RULES

## BLAZE
Only in holy fire can deviance be absolved. With flamer and burning hands the faithful purge the malignant taint of heresy.

Some weapons in this team's rules have the **Blaze** weapon rule below.

***Blaze:** If you inflict damage with any critical successes, the operative this weapon is being used against gains one of your Blaze tokens (if it doesn't already have one). Whenever an operative that has one of your Blaze tokens is activated, inflict D3 damage on it. Then that operative's controlling player selects one of the following:
- Roll one D6: on a 3+, remove that token.
- Subtract 1 from the operative's APL stat until the end of that activation to remove that token.

## MINISTORUM SERMON
A mighty orator booms out an impassioned sermon. The fire and brimstone words inflame the zeal of their followers, enabling them to shrug off wounds and remain in the fight.

**STRATEGIC GAMBIT.** Select one friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative. If a friendly **CONFESSOR** operative hasn't been incapacitated, you must select it. Until you use this **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** again during the battle, that operative has the **ORATOR** keyword.

Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is within 3" of a friendly **ORATOR** operative (or 6" if the **ORATOR** is a **CONFESSOR**), that friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is benefitting from the **SERMON**.

Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is activated within 3" of a friendly **ORATOR** operative (or 6" if the **ORATOR** is a **CONFESSOR**), that friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is benefitting from the **SERMON** until the end of that activation (i.e. even if it then moves more than the distance requirement from the **ORATOR** operative).

Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is benefitting from the **SERMON**, Normal and Critical Dmg of 3 or more inflicts 1 less damage on it.

# SANCTIFIERS OPERATIVES

## SANCTIFIERS - SANCTIFIER CONFESSOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 10

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Melee | Mace of Censure | 4 | 3+ | 5/5 | Brutal, Shock |

**Abilities:**
- **Lead the Procession:** In each turning point after the first, whenever this operative is an **ORATOR** and performs the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action during its activation, you can use this rule before it moves. If you do, determine each other friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that's benefitting from the **SERMON**. After this operative ends that action, each of those friendly **SANCTIFIER** operatives can immediately perform a free **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action in an order of your choice (choose separately for each), but each cannot move more than 3" and must end that move in a location where they are still benefitting from the **SERMON**. If this operative is incapacitated before this rule is fully resolved, e.g. from the **Guard** action's interruption (see close quarters rules, Kill Team Core Book), don't remove it from the killzone until this rule has been resolved.
- **Commanding Declamation:** Whenever an enemy operative would perform an action during an activation or counteraction while visible to and within 6" of this operative, you can use this rule. If you do, roll one D6: if the result is higher than that enemy operative's APL stat:
    - It cannot perform that action during that activation/counteraction (the AP spent on it isn't refunded). If it's a counteraction, that counteraction ends.
    - You cannot use this rule again during the battle.

## SANCTIFIERS - SANCTIFIER CHERUB
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 7"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 5

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Melee | Incentiviser | 3 | 5+ | 1/3 | Shock |

**Abilities:**
- **Cherub:**
    - Whenever determining control of an objective marker, treat this operative's APL stat as 1 lower. Note this isn't a change to its APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.
    - Whenever this operative has a Conceal order and is in cover, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. Seek, Vantage terrain) except being within 2".
    - This operative cannot use any weapons that aren't on its datacard, or perform unique actions other than **Incentivise**.
- **Fly:** Whenever this operative is performing the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, it can **FLY**. If it does, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up wholly within a distance equal to its Move stat horizontally of its original location (in a killzone that uses the close quarters rules, e.g. Killzone: Gallowdark, this distance cannot be measured over or through Wall terrain). Note that it gains no additional distance when performing the **Charge** action. It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it's the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within control range of an enemy operative.

**Unique Actions:**
- **INCENTIVISE [1AP]:** **SUPPORT**. Select one other friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative (excluding **CONFESSOR**, **DEATH CULT ASSASSIN**, **MIRACULIST** and **ORATOR**) visible to and within 2" of this operative. Until the end of that operative's next activation, add 1 to its APL stat. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## SANCTIFIERS - SANCTIFIER CONFLAGRATOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 7

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ranged | Twin hand flamers (focused) | 4 | 2+ | 3/3 | Range 6", Saturate, Torrent 2", Blaze* |
| Ranged | Twin hand flamers (twin torrent) | 4 | 2+ | 3/3 | Range 6", Saturate, Torrent 0", Twin Torrent¹, Blaze* |
| Melee | Gun butts | 4 | 4+ | 2/3 | |

**Abilities:**
- **Twin Torrent:** Select up to two different valid targets that aren't within control range of friendly operatives. Shoot with this weapon against both of them in an order of your choice (roll each sequence separately). **Torrent 0"** means you cannot select secondary targets, but this weapon still has the **Torrent** weapon rule for all other rules purposes, e.g. the Condensed Stronghold rule (see Killzone: Volkus, Kill Team Core Book).
- **Sanctification Rack:** This operative can perform the **Sanctification Orb** action (see faction equipment). Doing so in this manner doesn't count towards the once per turning point limit (i.e. if you also select that equipment for other operatives).

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, CONFLAGRATOR

## SANCTIFIERS - SANCTIFIER DEATH CULT ASSASSIN
**Stats:**
- APL: 3
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 8

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ranged | Throwing knives | 4 | 3+ | 2/5 | Range 6", Silent |
| Melee | Ritual blades | 4 | 2+ | 4/6 | |

**Abilities:**
- **Bladed Stance:** Whenever this operative is fighting or retaliating, you can resolve one of your successes before the normal order. If you do, that success must be used to block.

**Unique Actions:**
- **TRAINED ASSASSIN [1AP]:** Change this operative's order. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, DEATH CULT ASSASSIN

## SANCTIFIERS - SANCTIFIER DRILL ABBOT
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 7

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Melee | Great hammer | 4 | 4+ | 4/4 | Brutal, Shock |

**Abilities:**
- **Schola Progenium Disciplinarian:** Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is within 6" of this operative, you can ignore any changes to that operative's stats from being injured (including its weapons' stats).
- **Null Skull:** Whenever an enemy operative is within 6" of this operative, that enemy operative's APL stat cannot be added to (remove all positive APL stat changes it has). If an enemy operative that's more than 6" from this operative has a positive APL stat change and your opponent spends its final AP to move that operative within 6" of this operative, this can cause your opponent to have spent more AP than its APL stat - this is permitted in this situation.

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, DRILL ABBOT

## SANCTIFIERS - SANCTIFIER PERSECUTOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 7

| Melee | Eviscerator | 4 | 4+ | 5/6 | Brutal |

**Abilities:**
- **Merciless Castigation:** The first time this operative performs the **Fight** action during each of its activations, if neither it nor the enemy operative in that sequence is incapacitated, this operative can immediately perform a free **Fight** action afterwards, but you cannot select any other enemy operative to fight against during that action (and only if it's still valid to fight against). This takes precedence over action restrictions.
- **Fanatical Retribution:** If this operative is incapacitated during the **Fight** action, you can strike the enemy operative in that sequence with one of your unresolved successes before this operative is removed from the killzone.

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, PERSECUTOR

## SANCTIFIERS - SANCTIFIER MIRACULIST
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 4+

| Melee | Burning hands | 1 | 2+ | 7/8 | Brutal, Limited 1, Blaze* |
| Melee | Fists | 2 | 5+ | 1/2 | |

**Abilities:**
- **Wreathed:** This operative can perform the **Shoot** action with this weapon while within control range of an enemy operative. Don't select a valid target. Instead, this operative is always the primary target, but only shoot against secondary targets and they cannot be in cover or obscured (in other words, determine **Blast** from this operative, but this operative isn't affected).
- **Miracle:** The first time this operative would be incapacitated during the battle, it's not incapacitated, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be incapacitated for the remainder of the action. All remaining attack dice are discarded (including yours if this operative is fighting or retaliating), then this operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** or **Fall Back** action (for the latter, it cannot move more than 3"), even if it's performed an action that prevents it from performing those actions.

**Abilities:**
- **Cult Icon:** Whenever determining control of a marker within 6" of this operative, treat the total APL stat of friendly **SANCTIFIER** operatives that contest it as 1 higher if at least one friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative contests that marker. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.
- **Imperial Cult Devotion:** Once per turning point, when a ready friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is incapacitated while visible to and within 6" of this operative, you can use this rule. If you do, before that operative is removed from the killzone, it can perform one free action (excluding **Fight**), and you can change its order to do so.

# SANCTIFIERS STRATEGY PLOYS

## SANCTIFIERS - THE EMPEROR PROTECTS
The most dedicated adherents to the Imperial Creed believe that the Emperor protects. They hurl themselves into battle, confident that their faith will shield them.

Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that's benefitting from the **SERMON**, you can re-roll any of your defence dice results of one result (e.g. results of 2).

## SANCTIFIERS - FERVENT BRAWL
With the intolerant diatribes of the priesthood ringing in their ears, the Sanctifiers fight with a tireless fury.

Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that's benefitting from the **SERMON** is fighting or retaliating, its melee weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

## SANCTIFIERS - ZEALOUS PERSECUTION
The longer that heresy is allowed to persist, the more indelible the mark it leaves. It must be scoured swiftly and without mercy.

Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is fighting during an activation in which it performed the **Charge** action, its melee weapons have the **Lethal 5+** weapon rule.

## SANCTIFIERS - RALLY THE FLOCK
An orator's voice booms above the thunderous din of combat, drawing the faithful back into formation.

Each friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative (excluding **ORATOR**) that's benefitting from the **SERMON** can immediately perform a free **Dash** or **Fall Back** action in an order of your choice (choose separately for each and, for the latter, it cannot move more than 3"). Each that does so must end that move closer to a friendly **ORATOR** operative. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

# SANCTIFIERS FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## SANCTIFIERS - ROSARIUS
A sacred symbol of office, the Rosarius contains a powerful conversion field generator capable of turning aside incoming blows.

Use this firefight ploy when an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative. Ignore that inflicted damage.

## SANCTIFIERS - ARDENT ERADICATION
For those who stand against the Imperial faith there is only one punishment: death.

Use this firefight ploy after rolling your attack dice for a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative, if it's shooting against or fighting against an enemy operative that's within 3" of a friendly **ORATOR** operative (or 6" if the **ORATOR** is a **CONFESSOR**). You can re-roll any of your attack dice.

## SANCTIFIERS - REDEEMED THROUGH FIRE
There are few more blessed deaths than fiery martyrdom. Such a sacrifice stokes smouldering resolve in the hearts of fellow Sanctifiers.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that has a weapon with the **Blaze** weapon rule is incapacitated, before it's removed from the killzone. Each enemy operative visible to and within 2" of it gains one of your Blaze tokens (if it doesn't already have one).

## SANCTIFIERS - UNWAVERING DEVOTION
Low ranking Sanctifiers will gladly hurl themselves into the path of bullet or blade if doing so will preserve their blessed superiors and ensure victory.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **SANCTIFIER ORATOR** or **SANCTIFIER MIRACULIST** operative is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative (excluding **CONFESSOR**, **MIRACULIST** and **ORATOR**) visible to and within 3" of that first friendly operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being within the fighting operative's control range for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only in cover or obscured if the original target was.

This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

# SANCTIFIERS FACTION EQUIPMENT

## SANCTIFIERS - SANCTIFICATION ORBS
These spherical devices contain flammable oils. They shatter, ignite and detonate upon impact with their target, coating the foe in burning liquid.

Once per turning point, one friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative (excluding **CHERUB**, **DEATH CULT ASSASSIN** and **MIRACULIST**) can perform the following unique action:

**SANCTIFICATION ORB [1AP]**
- Select one enemy operative visible to and within 6" of this operative. That operative and each other enemy operative within 1" of it takes a doused test. For an operative to take a doused test, roll one D6: on a 3+, it gains one of your Doused tokens.
- Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is shooting against an operative that has one of your Doused tokens with a weapon that has the **Blaze** weapon rule, that weapon also has the **Seek** weapon rule.
- After a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative uses a weapon that has the **Blaze** weapon rule against an enemy operative that has one of your Doused tokens, remove that token (even if the **Seek** weapon rule wasn't used).
- This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## SANCTIFIERS - PURITY SEALS
Affixed to clothing, armour and wargear by way of wax seals, these pieces of parchment are inscribed with holy prayers and blessings.

Once per turning point, when a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is shooting or fighting, if you roll two or more fails, you can discard one of them to retain another as a normal success instead.

## SANCTIFIERS - ECCLESIARCHY TEXTS
The orators of the Adeptus Ministorum carry with them many a fiery prayer and excoriating psalm scribed on tattered vellum, designed to inspire their allies and diminish the foe.

In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, roll 2D6: if the result is less than the remaining wounds of a friendly **ORATOR** operative, you gain 1CP. Note that this is done before the Gambit step, so if there isn't a valid **ORATOR** operative, you cannot use this rule during that turning point (e.g. during the first turning point).

## SANCTIFIERS - IMPERIAL CULT SYMBOLS
Whether carved from stone or wrought in solid gold, blessed religious symbols bestow upon their bearers both fortune and favour.

Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that's benefitting from the **SERMON**, when you collect your defence dice, you can use this rule. If you do, change one of the attacker's retained critical successes to a normal success (any weapon rules they've already resolved aren't affected, e.g. **Piercing Crits**).

# SANCTIFIERS RULES COMMENTARY
[FAQ]
*Question:* If the **CONFESSOR** operative's **Commanding Declamation** rule prevents an enemy operative on guard from performing the **Shoot** or **Fight** action, does that enemy operative remain on guard?
*Answer:* Yes, assuming all other conditions of remaining on guard are still met.
---
[FAQ]
*Question:* Some rules require an operative to shoot or fight against a specific operative or its activation is cancelled (e.g. **MANDRAKE DIRGEMAW** Haunting Focus, **EXACTION SQUAD** Execution Order). If my opponent uses such a rule and I cancel that **Shoot** or **Fight** action with my **SANCTIFIER CONFESSOR** operative's **Commanding Declamation** rule, what happens?
*Answer:* Do not cancel that enemy operative's activation. It can continue to perform actions other than the prevented one as normal.
---
[FAQ]
*Question:* If my opponent uses a firefight ploy that requires an operative to perform a **Shoot** or **Fight** action (e.g. **HERNKYN YAEGIR** Stalwart Defence) and I cancel that action with my **SANCTIFIER CONFESSOR** operative's **Commanding Declamation** rule, is the CP refunded?
*Answer:* No. Similarly, any rules with a restricted number of uses (e.g. **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED FELARCH** One Step Ahead) that are prevented would still be considered used.
