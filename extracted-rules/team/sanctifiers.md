## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Archetypes
- SECURITY
- SEEK & DESTROY

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Faction Rule - BLAZE
Some weapons in this team's rules have the **Blaze** weapon rule below.

***Blaze:** If you inflict damage with any critical successes, the operative this weapon is being used against gains one of your Blaze tokens (if it doesn't already have one). Whenever an operative that has one of your Blaze tokens is activated, inflict D3 damage on it. Then that operative's controlling player selects one of the following:
- Roll one D6: on a 3+, remove that token.
- Subtract 1 from the operative's APL stat until the end of that activation to remove that token.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Faction Rule - MINISTORUM SERMON
**STRATEGIC GAMBIT**. Select one friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative. If a friendly **CONFESSOR** operative hasn't been **incapacitated**, you must select it. Until you use this **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** again during the battle, that operative has the **ORATOR** keyword.

Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is **wholly within 3"** of a friendly **ORATOR** operative (or **6"** if the **ORATOR** is a **CONFESSOR**), that friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is benefitting from the **SERMON**.

Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is activated **wholly within 3"** of a friendly **ORATOR** operative (or **6"** if the **ORATOR** is a **CONFESSOR**), that friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is benefitting from the **SERMON** until the end of that activation (i.e. even if it then moves more than the distance requirement from the **ORATOR** operative).

Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is benefitting from the **SERMON**, Normal and Critical Dmg of 3 or more inflicts 1 less damage on it.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CONFESSOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 10

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| melee | Mace of Censure | 4 | 3+ | 5/5 | Brutal, Shock |

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, LEADER, CONFESSOR

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CONFESSOR - Lead the Procession
In each turning point after the first, whenever this operative is an **ORATOR** and performs the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action during its activation, you can use this rule before it moves. If you do, determine each other friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that's benefitting from the **SERMON**. After this operative ends that action, each of those friendly **SANCTIFIER** operatives can immediately perform a free **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action in an order of your choice (choose separately for each), but each cannot move more than 3" and must end that move in a location where they are still benefitting from the **SERMON**. If this operative is **incapacitated** before this rule is fully resolved, e.g. from the **Guard** action's interruption (see close quarters rules, Kill Team Core Book), don't remove it from the killzone until this rule has been resolved.

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CONFESSOR - Commanding Declamation
Whenever an enemy operative would perform an action during an activation or counteraction while **visible** to and **wholly within 6"** of this operative, you can use this rule. If you do, roll one D6: if the result is higher than that enemy operative's APL stat:
- It cannot perform that action during that activation/counteraction (the AP spent on it isn't refunded). If it's a counteraction, that counteraction ends.
- You cannot use this rule again during the battle.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CHERUB
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 7"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 5

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| melee | Incentiviser | 3 | 5+ | 1/3 | Shock |

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, CHERUB

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CHERUB - Cherub
- Whenever determining control of an objective marker, treat this operative's APL stat as 1 lower. Note this isn't a change to its APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.
- Whenever this operative has a **Conceal** order and is **in cover**, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. Seek, Vantage terrain) except being **wholly within 2"**.
- This operative cannot use any weapons that aren't on its datacard, or perform unique actions other than **Incentivise**.

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CHERUB - Fly
Whenever this operative is performing the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, it can **FLY**. If it does, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up **wholly within** a distance equal to its Move stat horizontally of its original location (in a killzone that uses the close quarters rules, e.g. Killzone: Gallowdark, this distance cannot be measured over or through Wall terrain). Note that it gains no additional distance when performing the **Charge** action. It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it's the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within control range of an enemy operative.

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CHERUB - Incentivise
**1AP:** **SUPPORT**. Select one other friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative (excluding **CONFESSOR**, **DEATH CULT ASSASSIN**, **MIRACULIST** and **ORATOR**) **visible** to and **wholly within 2"** of this operative. Until the end of that operative's next activation, add 1 to its APL stat. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CONFLAGRATOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 7

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |

| ranged | Twin hand flamers (twin torrent) | 4 | 2+ | 3/3 | Range 6", Saturate, Torrent 0", Twin TorrentÂ¹, Blaze* |
| melee | Gun butts | 4 | 4+ | 2/3 | |

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, CONFLAGRATOR

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CONFLAGRATOR - Twin Torrent
Select up to two different valid targets that aren't within control range of friendly operatives. **Shoot** with this weapon against both of them in an order of your choice (roll each sequence separately). **Torrent 0"** means you cannot select secondary targets, but this weapon still has the **Torrent** weapon rule for all other rules purposes, e.g. the Condensed Stronghold rule (see Killzone: Volkus, Kill Team Core Book).

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER CONFLAGRATOR - Sanctification Rack
This operative can perform the **Sanctification Orb** action (see faction equipment). Doing so in this manner doesn't count towards the once per turning point limit (i.e. if you also select that equipment for other operatives).

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER DEATH CULT ASSASSIN
**Stats:**
- APL: 3
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 8

**Weapons:**

| melee | Ritual blades | 4 | 2+ | 4/6 | |

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, DEATH CULT ASSASSIN

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER DEATH CULT ASSASSIN - Bladed Stance
Whenever this operative is fighting or retaliating, you can resolve one of your successes before the normal order. If you do, that success must be used to block.

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER DEATH CULT ASSASSIN - Trained Assassin
**1AP:** Change this operative's order. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER DRILL ABBOT
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 7

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| melee | Great hammer | 4 | 4+ | 4/4 | Brutal, Shock |

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, DRILL ABBOT

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER DRILL ABBOT - Schola Progenium Disciplinarian
Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is **wholly within 6"** of this operative, you can ignore any changes to that operative's stats from being injured (including its weapons' stats).

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER DRILL ABBOT - Null Skull
Whenever an enemy operative is **wholly within 6"** of this operative, that enemy operative's APL stat cannot be added to (remove all positive APL stat changes it has). If an enemy operative that's more than 6" from this operative has a positive APL stat change and your opponent spends its final AP to move that operative **wholly within 6"** of this operative, this can cause your opponent to have spent more AP than its APL stat - this is permitted in this situation.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER PERSECUTOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 7

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ranged | Hand flamer | 4 | 3+ | 3/3 | Range 6", Saturate, Torrent 1", Blaze* |
| melee | Eviscerator | 4 | 4+ | 5/6 | Brutal |

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, PERSECUTOR

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER PERSECUTOR - Merciless Castigation
The first time this operative performs the **Fight** action during each of its activations, if neither it nor the enemy operative in that sequence is **incapacitated**, this operative can immediately perform a free **Fight** action afterwards, but you cannot select any other enemy operative to fight against during that action (and only if it's still valid to fight against). This takes precedence over action restrictions.

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER PERSECUTOR - Fanatical Retribution
If this operative is **incapacitated** during the **Fight** action, you can strike the enemy operative in that sequence with one of your unresolved successes before this operative is removed from the killzone.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER MIRACULIST
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 4+

| melee | Fists | 2 | 5+ | 1/2 | |

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, MIRACULIST

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER MIRACULIST - Wreathed
This operative can perform the **Shoot** action with this weapon while within control range of an enemy operative. Don't select a valid target. Instead, this operative is always the primary target, but only shoot against secondary targets and they cannot be **in cover** or **obscured** (in other words, determine **Blast** from this operative, but this operative isn't affected).

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER MIRACULIST - Miracle
The first time this operative would be **incapacitated** during the battle, it's not **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. All remaining attack dice are discarded (including yours if this operative is fighting or retaliating), then this operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** or **Fall Back** action (for the latter, it cannot move more than 3"), even if it's performed an action that prevents it from performing those actions.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER MISSIONARY
**Stats:**
- APL: 2

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, MISSIONARY

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER MISSIONARY - Holy Relic
If this operative has a holy relic, it's always benefitting from the **SERMON**.

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER MISSIONARY - Spread the Word of the God-Emperor
Whenever this operative is more than 6" from other friendly operatives, its weapons have the **Severe** weapon rule.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER PREACHER

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER RELIQUANT

- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 7

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, RELIQUANT

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER RELIQUANT - Cult Icon
Whenever determining control of a marker **wholly within 6"** of this operative, treat the total APL stat of friendly **SANCTIFIER** operatives that contest it as 1 higher if at least one friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative contests that marker. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER RELIQUANT - Imperial Cult Devotion
Once per turning point, when a ready friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is **incapacitated** while **visible** to and **wholly within 6"** of this operative, you can use this rule. If you do, before that operative is removed from the killzone, it can perform one free action (excluding **Fight**), and you can change its order to do so. It's then removed from the killzone as normal.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER SALVATIONIST
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 7

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| melee | Soulstave | 3 | 5+ | 2/3 | |

**Keywords:** SANCTIFIER, IMPERIUM, ADEPTUS MINISTORUM, MEDIC, SALVATIONIST

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER SALVATIONIST - Conversion Field
Whenever an operative more than 6" from this operative is shooting a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative **wholly within 6"** of this operative, improve that friendly operative's Save stat by 1 and worsen the x of the **Piercing** weapon rule by 1 (if any). Note that **Piercing 1** would therefore be ignored.

### SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Operatives - SANCTIFIER SALVATIONIST - Medikit
**1AP:** Select one friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative within this operative's control range to regain up to 2D3 lost wounds. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Strategy Ploy - THE EMPEROR PROTECTS
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that's benefitting from the **SERMON**, you can re-roll any of your defence dice results of one result (e.g. results of 2).

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Strategy Ploy - FERVENT BRAWL
Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that's benefitting from the **SERMON** is fighting or retaliating, its melee weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Strategy Ploy - ZEALOUS PERSECUTION
Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is fighting during an activation in which it performed the **Charge** action, its melee weapons have the **Lethal 5+** weapon rule.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Strategy Ploy - RALLY THE FLOCK
Each friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative (excluding **ORATOR**) that's benefitting from the **SERMON** can immediately perform a free **Dash** or **Fall Back** action in an order of your choice (choose separately for each and, for the latter, it cannot move more than 3"). Each that does so must end that move closer to a friendly **ORATOR** operative. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Firefight Ploy - ROSARIUS
Use this firefight ploy when an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative. Ignore that inflicted damage.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Firefight Ploy - ARDENT ERADICATION
Use this firefight ploy after rolling your attack dice for a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative, if it's shooting against or fighting against an enemy operative that's **wholly within 3"** of a friendly **ORATOR** operative (or **6"** if the **ORATOR** is a **CONFESSOR**). You can re-roll any of your attack dice.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Firefight Ploy - REDEEMED THROUGH FIRE
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that has a weapon with the **Blaze** weapon rule is **incapacitated**, before it's removed from the killzone. Each enemy operative **visible** to and **wholly within 2"** of it gains one of your Blaze tokens (if it doesn't already have one).

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Firefight Ploy - UNWAVERING DEVOTION
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **SANCTIFIER ORATOR** or **SANCTIFIER MIRACULIST** operative is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative (excluding **CONFESSOR**, **MIRACULIST** and **ORATOR**) **visible** to and **wholly within 3"** of that first friendly operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being within the fighting operative's control range for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only **in cover** or **obscured** if the original target was.

This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Faction Equipment - SANCTIFICATION ORBS
Once per turning point, one friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative (excluding **CHERUB**, **DEATH CULT ASSASSIN** and **MIRACULIST**) can perform the following unique action:

**SANCTIFICATION ORB [1AP]**
- Select one enemy operative **visible** to and **wholly within 6"** of this operative. That operative and each other enemy operative **wholly within 1"** of it takes a doused test. For an operative to take a doused test, roll one D6: on a 3+, it gains one of your Doused tokens.
- Whenever a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is shooting against an operative that has one of your Doused tokens with a weapon that has the **Blaze** weapon rule, that weapon also has the **Seek** weapon rule.
- After a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative uses a weapon that has the **Blaze** weapon rule against an enemy operative that has one of your Doused tokens, remove that token (even if the **Seek** weapon rule wasn't used).
- This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Faction Equipment - PURITY SEALS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative is shooting or fighting, if you roll two or more fails, you can discard one of them to retain another as a normal success instead.

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Faction Equipment - ECCLESIARCHY TEXTS
In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, roll 2D6: if the result is less than the remaining wounds of a friendly **ORATOR** operative, you gain 1CP. Note that this is done before the Gambit step, so if there isn't a valid **ORATOR** operative, you cannot use this rule during that turning point (e.g. during the first turning point).

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Faction Equipment - IMPERIAL CULT SYMBOLS
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **SANCTIFIER** operative that's benefitting from the **SERMON**, when you collect your defence dice, you can use this rule. If you do, change one of the attacker's retained critical successes to a normal success (any weapon rules they've already resolved aren't affected, e.g. **Piercing** Crits).

## SANCTIFIERS KILL TEAM - Rules Commentary
[FAQ]
***Question*:** If the **CONFESSOR** operative's **Commanding Declamation** rule prevents an enemy operative on guard from performing the **Shoot** or **Fight** action, does that enemy operative remain on guard?
***Answer*:** **Yes, assuming all other conditions of remaining on guard are still met.**
---
[FAQ]
***Question*:** Some rules require an operative to shoot or fight against a specific operative or its activation is cancelled (e.g. **MANDRAKE DIRGEMAW** Haunting Focus, **EXACTION SQUAD** Execution Order). If my opponent uses such a rule and I cancel that **Shoot** or **Fight** action with my **SANCTIFIER CONFESSOR** operative's **Commanding Declamation** rule, what happens?
***Answer*:** **Do not cancel that enemy operative's activation. It can continue to perform actions other than the prevented one as normal.**

[FAQ]
***Question*:** If my opponent uses a firefight ploy that requires an operative to perform a **Shoot** or **Fight** action (e.g. **HERNKYN YAEGIR** Stalwart Defence) and I cancel that action with my **SANCTIFIER CONFESSOR** operative's **Commanding Declamation** rule, is the CP refunded?
***Answer*:** **No. Similarly, any rules with a restricted number of uses (e.g. **CORSAIR VOIDSCARRED FELARCH** One Step Ahead) that are prevented would still be considered used.**
