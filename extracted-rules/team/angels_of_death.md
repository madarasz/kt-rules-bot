# Angels of Death Faction Rules

## Angels of Death - Chapter Tactics
When selecting your kill team, select a primary and secondary **Chapter Tactic** for friendly **Angels of Death** operatives to gain for the battle. Multiple instances of the same **Chapter Tactic** aren't cumulative.

1.  **Aggressive:** This operative's melee weapons have the **Rending** weapon rule.
2.  **Dueller:** Whenever this operative is fighting or retaliating, each of your normal successes can block one unresolved critical success (unless the enemy operative's weapon has the **Brutal** weapon rule).
3.  **Resolute:** You can ignore any changes to this operative's APL stat.
4.  **Stealthy:** Whenever an operative is shooting this operative, if you can retain any cover saves, you can retain one additional cover save, or you can retain one cover save as a critical success instead. This isn't cumulative with improved cover saves from Vantage terrain.
5.  **Mobile:**
    *   This operative can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.
    *   This operative can perform the **Charge** action while within control range of an enemy operative, and can leave that operative's control range to do so (but then normal requirements for that move apply).
6.  **Hardy:** Whenever an operative is shooting this operative, defence dice results of 5+ are critical successes.
7.  **Sharpshooter:** Whenever this operative is shooting during an activation in which it hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, its bolt weapons have the **Severe** weapon rule.
8.  **Siege Specialist:** This operative's ranged weapons have the **Saturate** weapon rule.

## Angels of Death - Astartes
During each friendly **Angels of Death** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions, a bolt weapon must be selected for at least one of them, and if it's a bolt sniper rifle or heavy bolter, 1 additional AP must be spent for the second action if both actions are using that weapon.

Each friendly **Angels of Death** operative can **counteract** regardless of its order.
