# ANGELS OF DEATH FACTION RULES

## ANGELS OF DEATH - CHAPTER TACTICS
When selecting your kill team, select a primary and secondary CHAPTER TACTIC for friendly ANGEL OF DEATH operatives to gain for the battle. Multiple instances of the same CHAPTER TACTIC aren't cumulative.

- **1. AGGRESSIVE:** This operative's melee weapons have the **Rending** weapon rule.
- **2. DUELLER:** Whenever this operative is fighting or retaliating, each of your normal successes can block one unresolved critical success (unless the enemy operative's weapon has the **Brutal** weapon rule).
- **3. RESOLUTE:** You can ignore any changes to this operative's APL stat.
- **4. STEALTHY:** Whenever an operative is shooting this operative, if you can retain any cover saves, you can retain one additional cover save, or you can retain one cover save as a critical success instead. This isn't cumulative with improved cover saves from Vantage terrain.
- **5. MOBILE:**
    - This operative can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.
    - This operative can perform the **Charge** action while within control range of an enemy operative, and can leave that operative's control range to do so (but then normal requirements for that move apply).
- **6. HARDY:** Whenever an operative is shooting this operative, defence dice results of 5+ are critical successes.
- **7. SHARPSHOOTER:** Whenever this operative is shooting during an activation in which it hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, its bolt weapons have the **Severe** weapon rule.
- **8. SIEGE SPECIALIST:** This operative's ranged weapons have the **Saturate** weapon rule.

## ANGELS OF DEATH - ASTARTES
During each friendly ANGEL OF DEATH operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions, a bolt weapon must be selected for at least one of them, and if it's a bolt sniper rifle or heavy bolter, 1 additional AP must be spent for the second action if both actions are using that weapon.

Each friendly ANGEL OF DEATH operative can counteract regardless of its order.
