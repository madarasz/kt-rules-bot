## ANGELS OF DEATH - Faction Rule - CHAPTER TACTICS

### ANGELS OF DEATH - Faction Rule - CHAPTER TACTICS - 1. AGGRESSIVE
This operative's melee weapons have the **Rending** weapon rule.

### ANGELS OF DEATH - Faction Rule - CHAPTER TACTICS - 2. DUELLER
Whenever this operative is fighting or retaliating, each of your normal successes can block one unresolved critical success (unless the enemy operative's weapon has the **Brutal** weapon rule).

### ANGELS OF DEATH - Faction Rule - CHAPTER TACTICS - 3. RESOLUTE
You can ignore any changes to this operative's APL stat.

### ANGELS OF DEATH - Faction Rule - CHAPTER TACTICS - 4. STEALTHY
Whenever an operative is shooting this operative, if you can retain any cover saves, you can retain one additional cover save, or you can retain one cover save as a critical success instead. This isn't cumulative with improved cover saves from Vantage terrain.

### ANGELS OF DEATH - Faction Rule - CHAPTER TACTICS - 5. MOBILE
*   This operative can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.
*   This operative can perform the **Charge** action while within **control range** of an enemy operative, and can leave that operative's **control range** to do so (but then normal requirements for that move apply).

### ANGELS OF DEATH - Faction Rule - CHAPTER TACTICS - 6. HARDY

If it's two **Shoot** actions, a bolt weapon must be selected for at least one of them, and if it's a bolt sniper rifle or heavy bolter, 1 additional AP must be spent for the second action if both actions are using that weapon.

Each friendly **ANGEL OF DEATH** operative can **counteract** regardless of its order.
