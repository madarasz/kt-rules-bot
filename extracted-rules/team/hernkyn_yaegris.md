## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Faction Rule - RESOURCEFUL
In the Ready step of each Strategy phase after the first, you gain Resourceful points determined by the number of friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operatives in the killzone that aren't within **control range** of enemy operatives. At the end of each turning point, discard your Resourceful points.

| 0-2        | 0                  |

Whenever a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative that isn't within **control range** of enemy operatives is activated, you can spend 1 of your Resourceful points to do one of the following:

### HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Operatives - YAEGIR IRONBRAEK - Minefield
You have five Minefield markers for the battle. On the reverse side, three of them are HY-Pex mines (see below) and two are blank. Set up all your Minefield markers as if they were one item of equipment. Each must be set up reverse-side down (their specifics aren't revealed), more than 2" from other markers, access points and **Accessible** terrain, and more than 6" from your opponent's drop zone and your other Minefield markers. Whenever this operative is readied, if it's not within **control range** of enemy operatives, you can reset one of your flipped Minefield markers that's within its **control range** (flip the marker back over again).

### HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Operatives - YAEGIR IRONBRAEK - HY-Pex Mines
Whenever one of your reverse-side down Minefield markers is both within an enemy operative's **control range** and not within a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative's **control range**, flip the marker over. If it's a blank, there's no effect. If it's a HY-Pex mine, inflict 3 damage on that enemy operative and roll one D6: if the result is less than that enemy operative's Save stat, inflict additional damage on it equal to the dice result; regardless of the result, if it isn't **incapacitated**, end its action (if any), even if that action's effects aren't fulfilled. If it cannot be placed, move it the minimum amount to do so. Regardless, that marker isn't removed.

### HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Operatives - YAEGIR WARRIOR - Intrepid
Whenever you spend a Resourceful point for this operative, the following take precedence:
*   If you add 1 to its APL stat, it lasts until the start of its next activation instead.
*   If it regains lost wounds, it regains up to 4 instead.

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Strategy Ploy - HIDDEN ENGAGEMENT
Whenever a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative is shooting, if it's **in cover** from the target's perspective, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule. Note that your opponent still determines the targeting lines for this (i.e. they decide which point of their operative's base targeting lines are drawn from).

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Strategy Ploy - MASTERFUL BLADEWORK
Whenever a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative is fighting, or has a **Conceal** order and is retaliating, add 1 to the Atk stat of its melee weapons (to a maximum of 4) and they have the **Balanced** weapon rule; if the weapon already has that weapon rule, it has the **Ceaseless** weapon rule instead of **Balanced**.

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Strategy Ploy - TOUGH SURVIVALISTS
The first time an attack dice inflicts damage on each friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative during the turning point in the Resolve Attack Dice step, you can halve that inflicted damage (rounding up, to a minimum of 2).

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Strategy Ploy - IN POSITION
Whenever a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative has a **Conceal** order and is **in cover**, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. **Seek**, **Vantage** terrain) except being **within** 2".

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Firefight Ploy - STURDY
Use this firefight ploy when an operative is shooting a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative, when you collect your defence dice. Change the attacker's retained critical successes to normal successes (any weapon rules they've already resolved aren't affected, e.g. **Piercing** Crits).

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Firefight Ploy - BONDS THAT BIND
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative is activated. Select one other ready friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative **visible** to and **within** 3" of that operative. When that first friendly operative is expended, you can activate that other friendly operative before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal.
Neither operative can be a **BOMBAST** operative if its Wroughtlock Negotiation **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** has been used this turning point.

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Firefight Ploy - NO KIN LEFT BEHIND
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative is **incapacitated**. Before that operative is removed from the killzone, remove your Fallen Kin marker from the killzone (if any), then place it within that operative's **control range**. That operative is then removed from the killzone as normal.
Whenever a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative **within** 3" of your Fallen Kin marker is shooting, fighting or retaliating, in the Roll Attack Dice step, you can retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it, or retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Firefight Ploy - STALWART DEFENCE
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative ends a move within **control range** of a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative. Select one other friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative **visible** to and **within** 6" of that friendly operative, but that isn't itself within **control range** of enemy operatives. The selected operative can perform a free **Shoot** action. During that action:
*   It can target that enemy operative even though it's within **control range** of a friendly operative.
*   You cannot select any other enemy operative as a valid target.
*   You cannot select a frag or krak grenade, or a weapon with the **Blast** or x" **Devastating** x weapon rule (i.e. **Devastating** with a distance).

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Faction Equipment - PLASMA KNIVES
Friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operatives have the following melee weapon. Note that some operatives already have this weapon but with better stats; in that instance, use the better version, and that weapon has the **Balanced** weapon rule for the battle.

| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plasma knife | 3 | 4+ | 3/5 | Lethal 5+ |

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Faction Equipment - STABILISED BOLT SHELLS
Up to twice per turning point, whenever a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a bolt shotgun (long range), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, improve the Hit stat of that weapon by 1 and add 1 to both of its Dmg stats.

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Faction Equipment - FIRESTORM BOLT SHELLS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a bolt shotgun (short range), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Blast 1"** weapon rule.

## HERNKYN YAEGIRS - Faction Equipment - KV-CERAMIDE UNDERSUIT
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operative, if the ranged weapon in that sequence has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule, you can re-roll one of your defence dice. In addition, friendly **HERNKYN YAEGIR** operatives aren't affected by the x" **Devastating** x weapon rule (i.e. **Devastating** with a distance) unless they are the target during that sequence.
