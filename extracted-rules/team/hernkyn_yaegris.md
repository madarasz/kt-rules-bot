# Hernkyn Yaegirs Faction Rules

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Resourceful
Hernkyn Yaegirs are self-sufficiency specialists.

In the Ready step of each Strategy phase after the first, you gain Resourceful points determined by the number of friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operatives in the killzone that aren't within control range of enemy operatives. At the end of each turning point, discard your Resourceful points.

| Operatives | Resourceful Points |
|------------|--------------------|
| 6+         | 2                  |
| 3-5        | 1                  |
| 0-2        | 0                  |

Whenever a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative that isn't within control range of enemy operatives is activated, you can spend 1 of your Resourceful points to do one of the following:
- Until the end of its activation, add 1 to its APL stat.
- It regains up to D3+1 lost wounds.

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Dauntless Explorers
The first of their Kindred to set foot on new worlds, Yaegirs are frequently deployed for extended periods.

**Strategic Gambit:** In the first turning point, each friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative wholly within your drop zone can immediately perform a free **Reposition** action. Each that does must end that move wholly within 4" of your drop zone.

**Abilities:**
- **Minefield:** Before the battle, place Minefield markers for the battle. One is a HY-Pex Mine, one is a Stabilised Bolt Shells Mine, and three of them are HY-Pex mines (see below) and two are blank. Set up all your Minefield markers as if they were one item of equipment. Each must be set up reverse-side down (their specifics aren't revealed), more than 2" from other markers, access points and Accessible terrain, and more than 6" from your opponent's drop zone and your other Minefield markers. Whenever this operative is readied, if it's not within control range of enemy operatives, you can reveal one of your unrevealed Minefield markers that's within its control range (flip that marker back over again).
- **Mine Detonation:** Whenever an operative moves within 1" of one of your revealed Minefield markers, that marker detonates. Both players roll one D6. If your result is higher, that operative's control range and not within a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative's control range, flip the marker over. If it's a blank, there's no effect. If it's a HY-Pex Mine, that operative suffers D3+3 mortal wounds. If it's a Stabilised Bolt Shells Mine, that operative suffers D3 mortal wounds. You can resolve damage on it equal to the dice result; regardless of the result, if it isn't incapacitated, end its action (if any), even if that action's effects are still to be resolved (the operative cannot move further). If it's unable to, regardless, the marker isn't removed.

# Hernkyn Yaegirs Strategy Ploys

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Hidden Engagement
Whenever a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative is shooting, if it's in cover from the target's perspective, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule. Note that your opponent still determines the targeting lines for this (i.e. they decide which point of their operative's base targeting lines are drawn from).

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Masterful Bladework
Whenever a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative is fighting, or has a Conceal order and is retaliating, add 1 to the Atk stat of its melee weapons (to a maximum of 4) and they have the **Balanced** weapon rule; if the weapon already has that weapon rule, it has the **Ceaseless** weapon rule instead of **Balanced**.

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Tough Survivalists
The first time an attack dice inflicts damage on each friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative during a turning point, in the Resolve Attack Dice step, you can halve that inflicted damage (rounding up, to a minimum of 2).

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - In Position
Whenever a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative has a Conceal order and is in cover, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. **Seek**, Vantage terrain) except being within 2".

# Hernkyn Yaegirs Firefight Ploys

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Sturdy
Use this firefight ploy when an operative is shooting a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative, when you collect your defence dice. Change the attacker's retained critical successes to normal successes (any weapon rules they've already resolved aren't affected, e.g. **Piercing** Crits).

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Bonds That Bind
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative is activated. Select one other ready friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative visible to and within 3" of that operative. When that first friendly operative is expended, you can activate that other friendly operative before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal.
Neither operative can be a **Bombast** operative if its Wroughtlock Negotiation **Strategic Gambit** has been used this turning point.

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - No Kin Left Behind
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative is incapacitated. Before that operative is removed from the killzone, remove your Fallen Kin marker from the killzone (if any), then place it within that operative's control range. That operative is then removed from the killzone as normal.
Whenever a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative within 3" of your Fallen Kin marker is shooting, fighting or retaliating, in the Roll Attack Dice step, you can retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it, or retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Stalwart Defence
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative ends a move. Select one other friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative visible to and within 6" of that friendly operative, but that isn't itself within control range of enemy operatives. The selected operative can perform a free **Shoot** action. During that action:
- It can target that enemy operative even though it's within control range of a friendly operative.
- You don't need to use any other enemy operative as a valid target.
- You can only select a frag or krak grenade, or a weapon with the **Blast** or x" **Devastating** x weapon rule (i.e. **Devastating** with a distance).

# Hernkyn Yaegirs Faction Equipment

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Plasma Knives
Friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operatives have the following melee weapon. Note that some operatives already have this weapon but with better stats; in that instance, use the better version, and that weapon has the **Balanced** weapon rule for the battle.

| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | WR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plasma knife | 3 | 4+ | 3/5 | Lethal 5+ |

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Stablysed Bolt Shells
Up to twice per turning point, whenever a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a bolt shotgun (long range), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, improve the Hit stat of that weapon by 1 and add 1 to both of its Dmg stats.

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - Firestorm Bolt Shells
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a bolt revolver or a bolt shotgun (short range), you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Blast 1"** weapon rule.

## Hernkyn Yaegirs - KV-Ceramide Undersuit
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operative, if the ranged weapon in that sequence has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule, you can re-roll one of your defence dice. In addition, friendly **Hernkyn Yaegir** operatives aren't affected by the x" **Devastating** x weapon rule (i.e. **Devastating** with a distance) unless they are the target during that sequence.
