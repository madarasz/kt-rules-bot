# Wrecka Krew Faction Rules

## Wrecka Krew - Wrecka Rampage
Whenever a friendly **Wrecka Krew** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, in the Roll Attack Dice step:
- For each attack dice result of 6 you retain, you gain one Wrecka point.
- You can spend up to 3 of your Wrecka points (unless it's a **Bomb Squig**, then you cannot spend any). For each point you spend this way, retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it.

You cannot have more than 6 Wrecka points at once. You can gain and spend Wrecka points during the same action and can do so in an order of your choice, unless you started the action with 6, in which case you can only spend them.

## Wrecka Krew - Tanked Up
Whenever a friendly **Wrecka Krew** operative (excluding **Bomb Squig**) that has an **Engage** order performs the **Shoot** or **Fight** action (excluding **Guard**), add 1 to its APL stat until the start of its next activation.

## Wrecka Krew - Tankbusta Rokkiteer
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 6"
- Save: 4+
- Wounds: 12

**Weapons:**

**Abilities:**
- ***Pulsa:** Don't select a valid target. Instead, place your Pulsa marker visible to this operative, or on Vantage terrain of a terrain feature that's visible to this operative. That marker gains 1 Pulsa point, then roll attack dice: it gains 1 additional Pulsa point for each success (to a maximum of 3 additional points). Separately inflict D3 damage on each operative wholly within x" of that marker, where x is that marker's Pulsa points. Then the action ends.
- **Shokkwave:** Whenever an operative is within x" of your Pulsa marker (see left), worsen the Hit stat of its weapons by 1 and subtract 2" from its Move stat. This is cumulative with being injured. X is that marker's Pulsa points. In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, subtract 1 from your Pulsa marker's points. If a Pulsa marker ever has 0 points, remove it.

# Wrecka Krew Firefight Ploys

## Wrecka Krew - Just A Scratch
Use this firefight ploy when an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on a friendly **Wrecka Krew** operative (excluding **Bomb Squig**). Ignore that inflicted damage.

## Wrecka Krew - Demolition Job
Use this firefight ploy after a friendly **Wrecka Krew** operative performs the **Shoot** or **Fight** action, just before incapacitated operatives are removed (if any). Place one of your Demolition markers within the target's control range (if it's using a **Blast** weapon, the primary target). Whenever a friendly **Wrecka Krew** operative (excluding **Bomb Squig**) is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an operative that's within 3" of that marker, you can spend a Wrecka point for free (even if you have none). In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, remove that marker.

## Wrecka Krew - Kaboom!
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Wrecka Krew** operative performs the **Shoot** action and a weapon with the **Blast** weapon rule is selected. Until the end of that action, add 1" to that weapon's **Blast** and it has the **Severe** weapon rule when shooting the primary target. You cannot use this ploy and the Drill Rokkits rule (see faction equipment) during the same action. Note that **Severe** doesn't generate a Wrecka point (as it's not a 6).

## Wrecka Krew - Drill Rokkits
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Wrecka Krew** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a rokkit launcha or 'eavy rokkit launcha, you can use this rule.

Subtract 1" from the Move stat of friendly **Wrecka Krew** operatives and add 1 to their Wounds stat. This excludes **Bomb Squig** operatives.

## Wrecka Krew - Engine Oil
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Wrecka Krew** operative (excluding **Bomb Squig**) is activated, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that activation, you can ignore any changes to that operative's stats from being injured (including its weapons' stats).

## Wrecka Krew - Glyphs
When this item of equipment is selected, also select the Waaagh! or Destruction strategy ploy. The first time you would use that ploy during the battle, it costs you 0CP; whenever you would use it thereafter, it costs you 0CP if you have any Wrecka points.
