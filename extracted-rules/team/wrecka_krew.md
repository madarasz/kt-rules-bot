## WRECKA KREW - Faction Rule - WRECKA RAMPAGE
The sound of explosions, the acrid stench of smoke and the screams of battle drive Wrecka Krews forwards to ever more destructive acts.

Whenever a friendly **WRECKA KREW** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, in the Roll Attack Dice step:
- For each attack dice result of 6 you retain, you gain one Wrecka point.
- You can spend up to 3 of your Wrecka points (unless it's a **BOMB SQUIG**, then you cannot spend any). For each point you spend this way, retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it.

You cannot have more than 6 Wrecka points at once. You can gain and spend Wrecka points during the same action and can do so in an order of your choice, unless you started the action with 6, in which case you can only spend them.

## WRECKA KREW - Faction Rule - TANKED UP
Wrecka Krews are empowered by the thrill of explosive combat, lending them fresh impetus as they undertake their murderous rampages.

Whenever a friendly **WRECKA KREW** operative (excluding **BOMB SQUIG**) that has an **Engage** order performs the **Shoot** or **Fight** action (excluding **Guard**), add 1 to its APL stat until the start of its next activation.

**Keywords:** WRECKA KREW, ORK, TANKBUSTA, ROKKITEER

### WRECKA KREW - Operatives - TANKBUSTA ROKKITEER - Pulsa
Don't select a valid target. Instead, place your Pulsa marker **visible** to this operative, or on Vantage terrain of a terrain feature that's **visible** to this operative. That marker gains 1 Pulsa point, then roll attack dice: it gains 1 additional Pulsa point for each success (to a maximum of 3 additional points). Separately inflict D3 damage on each operative **wholly within x"** of that marker, where x is that marker's Pulsa points. Then the action ends.

### WRECKA KREW - Operatives - TANKBUSTA ROKKITEER - Shokkwave
Whenever an operative is **within x"** of your Pulsa marker (see left), worsen the Hit stat of its weapons by 1 and subtract 2" from its Move stat. This is cumulative with being injured. X is that marker's Pulsa points. In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, subtract 1 from your Pulsa marker's points. If a Pulsa marker ever has 0 points, remove it.

## WRECKA KREW - Firefight Ploy - DEMOLITION JOB
Use this firefight ploy after a friendly **WRECKA KREW** operative performs the **Shoot** or **Fight** action, just before **incapacitated** operatives are removed (if any). Place one of your Demolition markers within the target's control range (if it's using a **Blast** weapon, the primary target). Whenever a friendly **WRECKA KREW** operative (excluding **BOMB SQUIG**) is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an operative that's **within 3"** of that marker, you can spend a Wrecka point for free (even if you have none).

## WRECKA KREW - Firefight Ploy - KABOOM!
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **WRECKA KREW** operative performs the **Shoot** action and a weapon with the **Blast** weapon rule is selected. Until the end of that action, add 1" to that weapon's **Blast** and it has the **Severe** weapon rule when shooting the primary target. You cannot use this ploy and the Drill Rokkits rule (see faction equipment) during the same action. Note that **Severe** doesn't generate a Wrecka point (as it's not a 6).

## WRECKA KREW - Faction Equipment - DRILL ROKKITS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **WRECKA KREW** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a rokkit launcha or 'eavy rokkit launcha, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, that weapon loses the **Blast** weapon rule but has the **Piercing 1** weapon rule.

## WRECKA KREW - Faction Equipment - EXTRA ARMOUR
Subtract 1" from the Move stat of friendly **WRECKA KREW** operatives and add 1 to their Wounds stat. This excludes **BOMB SQUIG** operatives.

## WRECKA KREW - Faction Equipment - ENGINE OIL
Once per turning point, when a friendly **WRECKA KREW** operative (excluding **BOMB SQUIG**) is activated, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that activation, you can ignore any changes to that operative's stats from being injured (including its weapons' stats).

## WRECKA KREW - Faction Equipment - GLYPHS
