## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Faction Rule - DROP INSERTION
When setting up a **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** kill team before the battle, the first third of your kill team must be set up as normal. Each third thereafter can be set up above: place them to one side instead of in the killzone. For each third that's set up above, you must set up the whole third in this way (not some of them), then place one of your Drop markers wholly within your drop zone.

As a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in the first and second turning point, you can move your Drop markers up to 4" horizontally. In a killzone that uses the close quarters rules (e.g. Killzone: Gallowdark), this can be measured and moved through Wall terrain.

In the Firefight phase, friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operatives set up above are activated as normal. When you do, you can either expend or land that operative. If it lands, set it up in the killzone in a location it can be placed as follows (it's no longer set up above):
- Within 3" horizontally of one of your Drop markers, or wholly within your drop zone.
- Not within **control range** of enemy operatives (unless you're setting up a **PRECURSOR** operative, which can be set up within **control range** of an enemy operative).
- With no part of its base underneath **Vantage** terrain.
- With an order of your choice.

The operative is treated as performing the **Reposition** action (spend the AP accordingly), then continue its activation as normal. It's **obscured** until the end of the next activation or the end of the turning point (whichever comes first).

Less than half of your operatives can be set up above by the end of the first turning point. In other words, by the end of the first turning point, more than half of your operatives must have been set up in the killzone during the battle.

When readying your operatives during the second and third turning points, remove one of your Drop markers. This means operatives still set up above are **incapacitated** at the end of the second turning point.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Faction Rule - GRAV-CHUTE
Whenever a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative is dropping, ignore the vertical distance.

Whenever an enemy operative within 8" of this operative shoots this operative, keep track of each attack dice that's discarded as a fail. After the action, before **incapacitated** operatives are removed (including this one, if relevant), this operative can perform a free **Shoot** action (you can change its order to Engage to do so), but it can only target that enemy operative with its hot-shot laspistols (focused), and you only roll a number of attack dice equal to the opponent's discarded attack dice plus one (to a maximum of four).

### TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Operatives - AQUILON TROOPER - Rapid Insertion
**STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in the first Strategy phase. Each friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON TROOPER** operative wholly within your drop zone can immediately perform a free **Reposition** action, but must end that move wholly within 3" of your drop zone.

### TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Operatives - AQUILON TROOPER - Swift Landing
When this operative lands, you can set it up within 4" horizontally of one of your Drop markers, taking precedence over the normal distance requirement.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Strategy Ploy - SUDDEN OFFENSIVE
Count the number of friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operatives that aren't **incapacitated**, then halve the result (rounding up) to give you x. Until the end of their activation, friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operatives' weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule if they are the first friendly operatives activated this turning point equal to x. For example, if you have five operatives, the first three friendly operatives activated will benefit.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Strategy Ploy - MAINTAIN MOMENTUM
Whenever a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative is shooting against or fighting against a ready enemy operative, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Severe** weapon rule.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Strategy Ploy - EYE ABOVE
Select one enemy operative. That operative and each other enemy operative within 3" of it gains one of your Detected tokens until the end of the turning point. Whenever an enemy operative that has one of your Detected tokens:
- Is shooting a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.
- Is fighting or retaliating against a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative, one of your blocks can be allocated to block two unresolved successes (instead of one).

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Strategy Ploy - DROP AND SECURE
Select one marker.
- Until the Ready step of the next turning point, when determining control of that marker, treat the total APL stat of friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operatives that contest it as 1 higher if at least one friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative contests that marker. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.
- Whenever a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative is within 3" of that marker, add 1 to the Atk stat of its melee weapons (to a maximum of 4).

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Firefight Ploy - HOT DROP
Use this firefight ploy after rolling your attack dice for a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative that's wholly within your opponent's territory, or either landed or dropped from **Vantage** terrain at least 2" higher than the killzone floor during this activation. If the target is within 6" of it, you can re-roll any of your attack dice.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Firefight Ploy - ADJUST COORDINATES
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative lands. You can set it up within 5" horizontally of one of your Drop markers, taking precedence over the normal distance requirement. It cannot perform the **Dash**, **Shoot** or **Fight** actions during this turning point.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Firefight Ploy - TEMPESTUS EXEMPLARS
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative's activation (excluding **SERVO-SENTRY** and any operative that has an APL stat higher than 2). During that activation it can perform the **Pick Up Marker**, **Place Marker** or a mission action for 1 less AP.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Firefight Ploy - PROGENA
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative (excluding **SERVO-SENTRY**) is activated. It regains up to 2D3 lost wounds, and during that activation you can ignore any changes to its APL stat.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Faction Equipment - TEMPESTUS DAGGERS
Friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operatives (excluding **SERVO-SENTRY**) have the following melee weapon:
| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG |

| Tempestus dagger | 3 | 4+ | 3/4 |

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Faction Equipment - COMBAT STIMMS
You can ignore any changes to the Move stat of friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operatives from being injured.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Faction Equipment - DROP AUGURY
Once per battle, when a friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operative that's set up above is activated, before expending or landing that operative, you can move one of your Drop markers again. However, it cannot be moved closer to your opponent's drop zone.

## TEMPESTUS AQUILONS - Faction Equipment - REMOTE OVERSEER
Once per battle, after rolling off to decide initiative, you can re-roll your dice.
