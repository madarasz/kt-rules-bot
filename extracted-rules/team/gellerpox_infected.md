# Gellerpox Infected Faction Rules

## Gellerpox Infected - Techno-Curse
At the end of the Select Operatives step, select one **Techno-Curse** for friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operatives to gain for the battle. Whenever an enemy operative is within a selected **Techno-Curse's** infection range, that enemy operative is affected by the symptom of the selected **Techno-Curse**. Each **Techno-Curse**, its infection range and its symptom is listed below:

- **Barrelwarp:**
  - **Infection Range:** Within 2" of a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative (excluding **Mutoid Vermin**), or within 3" of a friendly **Gellerpox Infected Glitchling** operative.
  - **Symptom:** Subtract 1 from the Atk stat of that enemy operative's ranged weapons.

- **Screaming Rustspikes:**
  - **Infection Range:** Within control range of a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative (excluding **Mutoid Vermin**).
  - **Symptom:** Whenever that enemy operative is fighting or retaliating against a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative, if your opponent discards any attack dice as a fail, inflict 1 Damage on that enemy operative.

- **Viral Vox-static:**
  - **Infection Range:** Within 3" of a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative (excluding **Mutoid Vermin**), or within 4" of a friendly **Gellerpox Infected Glitchling** operative.
  - **Symptom:** That enemy operative's APL stat cannot be added to (remove all positive APL stat changes it has).

## Gellerpox Infected - Mutoid Vermin
**Mutoid Vermin** operatives cannot perform any actions other than **Charge**, **Dash**, **Fall Back**, **Fight**, **Reposition** and **Shoot**, or use any weapons that aren't on their datacard. They can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.

**Mutoid Vermin** operatives cannot contest markers or areas of the killzone, and are ignored for your opponent's kill/elimination op (when they're incapacitated, and when determining your starting number of operatives). They're also ignored for victory conditions and scoring VPs if either require operatives to 'escape', 'survive' or be incapacitated by enemy operatives.

Operatives can move through **Mutoid Vermin** operatives, and enemy operatives can move within control range of them. Having only **Mutoid Vermin** operatives within their control range doesn't prevent enemy operatives from performing the **Charge**, **Dash** and **Reposition** action, and enemy operatives can leave **Mutoid Vermin** operatives' control range when performing the **Charge** action.

## Gellerpox Infected - Nightmare Hulks
Whenever your opponent is selecting a valid target, friendly **Gellerpox Infected Nightmare Hulk** operatives cannot use Light terrain for cover. While this can allow such operatives to be targeted (assuming they're visible), it doesn't remove their cover save (if any).

Friendly **Gellerpox Infected Nightmare Hulk** operatives cannot perform unique actions. You must spend 1 additional AP for friendly **Gellerpox Infected Nightmare Hulk** operatives (excluding **Vulgrar Thrice-Cursed**) to perform the **Pick Up Marker** and mission actions (excluding **Operate Hatch**).

## Gellerpox Infected - Revoltingly Resilient
Whenever an attack dice inflicts damage of 3 or more on a friendly **Gellerpox Infected Nightmare Hulk** or **Gellerpox Infected Mutant** operative, roll one D6: on a 4+, subtract 1 from that inflicted damage.

# Gellerpox Infected Strategy Ploys

## Gellerpox Infected - Plagueridden Determination
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative (excluding **Mutoid Vermin**) that has an **Engage** order, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## Gellerpox Infected - Blessings of Infection
Whenever a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative is fighting or retaliating, you can do one of the following:
- If you roll three or more fails, you can discard one of them to retain another as a normal success instead.
- If you roll three or more successes, you can discard one of your fails to retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## Gellerpox Infected - Drawn to the Hum
Select one objective marker. Whenever a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative performs the **Reposition** or **Charge** action during its activation, you can use this rule. If you do, add 1" to its Move stat until the end of that activation, but it must end that move within 2" of that objective marker.

## Gellerpox Infected - Rust Emanations
Whenever an enemy operative is within control range of friendly **Gellerpox Infected Nightmare Hulk** operatives, worsen the Hit stat of that enemy operative's weapons by 1. This isn't cumulative with being injured.

# Gellerpox Infected Firefight Ploys

## Gellerpox Infected - Revolting Technology
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative is shooting a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative. That operative's ranged weapons have the **Hot** weapon rule until the end of that sequence; if the weapon already has that weapon rule, when your opponent rolls one D6 for that weapon rule, you can choose to subtract 1 from the result. Note that for the latter you can see the result of your opponent's roll for the **Hot** weapon rule before deciding to use this ploy.

## Gellerpox Infected - Barge
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Gellerpox Infected Nightmare Hulk** operative's activation or counteraction, before or after it performs an action. During that activation/counteraction:
- It can move through enemy operatives and within control range of them.
- It can perform the **Charge** and **Reposition** actions while within control range of an enemy operative, and can leave that operative's control range to do so (but the normal requirements for that move apply).

## Gellerpox Infected - Putrescent Demise
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative (excluding **Mutoid Vermin**) is incapacitated, before it's removed from the killzone. Inflict 1 damage (or D3 damage instead if that friendly operative is a **Nightmare Hulk**) on each enemy operative visible to and within 2" of that friendly operative.

## Gellerpox Infected - Frightening Onslaught
Use this firefight ploy after a friendly **Gellerpox Infected Nightmare Hulk** operative performs the **Fight** action, if it isn't incapacitated. It can immediately perform a free **Fight** action (you don't have to select the same enemy operative to fight against). This takes precedence over action restrictions.

# Gellerpox Infected Faction Equipment

## Gellerpox Infected - Mutoid Vermin
After revealing this equipment option, add four **Gellerpox Infected Mutoid Vermin** operatives to your kill team for the battle. You can select this equipment option up to twice per battle.

## Gellerpox Infected - Polluted Stockpile
After revealing this equipment option, roll 2D6: on a 7+, remove one of your opponent's selected equipment options; otherwise, that player removes one of their own selected equipment options. They cannot select that equipment again during the game sequence (e.g. in the Scouting step of Approved Ops). You cannot select this equipment option after the Select Operatives step.

## Gellerpox Infected - Mutated Symptoms
Once per battle, when you activate a friendly **Gellerpox Infected** operative, you can select one additional **Techno-Curse** for that operative to gain until the end of the turning point (it must be different from your existing **Techno-Curse**). Note that if a rule refers to an enemy operative being affected by your selected **Techno-Curse** rule (e.g. **Vulgrar Thrice-Cursed** operative's Spread the Glorious Gifts rule), it's affected by your additional **Techno-Curse** rule too.

## Gellerpox Infected - Plague Bellows
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Gellerpox Infected Nightmare Hulk** operative that's more than 6" from it, you can retain one of your defence dice results of 3 as a normal success instead of discarding it.
