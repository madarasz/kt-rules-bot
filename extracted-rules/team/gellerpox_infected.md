## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Archetypes
- SECURITY
- SEEK & DESTROY

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Rule - TECHNO-CURSE
At the end of the Select Operatives step, select one **TECHNO-CURSE** for friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operatives to gain for the battle. Whenever an enemy operative is within your selected **TECHNO-CURSE**'s infection range, that enemy operative is affected by the symptom of the selected **TECHNO-CURSE**. Each **TECHNO-CURSE**, its infection range and its symptom is listed below:

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Rule - TECHNO-CURSE - Barrelwarp
As the Gellerpox infects ranged weapons, it warps barrels and corrodes rifling, reducing the effectiveness of such weapons.
*   **Infection Range:** Within 2" of a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative (excluding **MUTOID VERMIN**), or within 3" of a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED GLITCHLING** operative.
*   **Symptom:** Subtract 1 from the Atk stat of that enemy operative's ranged weapons.

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Rule - TECHNO-CURSE - Screaming Rustspikes
Blades equipped by the enemy become strange and twisted, with spikes bursting from sword grips to pierce the flesh of the wielder.
*   **Infection Range:** Within control range of a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative (excluding **MUTOID VERMIN**).
*   **Symptom:** Whenever that enemy operative is fighting or retaliating against a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative, if your opponent discards any attack dice as a fail, inflict 1 damage on that enemy operative.

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Rule - TECHNO-CURSE - Viral Vox-static
Discordant static noise and ear-piercing screams blare over vox-channels, disrupting the enemy's communications, breaking their chain of command and sowing fear within their ranks.
*   **Infection Range:** Within 3" of a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative (excluding **MUTOID VERMIN**), or within 4" of a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED GLITCHLING** operative.
*   **Symptom:** That enemy operative's APL stat cannot be added to (remove all positive APL stat changes it has).

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Rule - MUTOID VERMIN
Tiny pests become monstrous threats under the effects of the Gellerpox, but are still grubs that can be ignored by highly trained warriors.

**MUTOID VERMIN** operatives cannot perform any actions other than **Charge**, **Dash**, **Fall Back**, **Fight**, **Reposition** and **Shoot**, or use any weapons that aren't on their datacard. They can perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.

**MUTOID VERMIN** operatives cannot contest markers or areas of the killzone, and are ignored for your opponent's kill/elimination op (when they're **incapacitated**, and when determining your starting number of operatives). They're also ignored for victory conditions and scoring VPs if either require operatives to 'escape', 'survive' or be **incapacitated** by enemy operatives (if they escape/survive/are **incapacitated**, determining how many operatives must escape/survive/be **incapacitated**, etc.).

Operatives can move through **MUTOID VERMIN** operatives, and enemy operatives can move within control range of them. Having only **MUTOID VERMIN** operatives within their control range doesn't prevent enemy operatives from performing the **Charge**, **Dash** and **Reposition** action, and enemy operatives can leave **MUTOID VERMIN** operatives' control range when performing the **Charge** action.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Rule - NIGHTMARE HULKS
Several among the infected have had their forms bloated and swollen into enormous twisted creatures, blessed with the bounteous gifts of Nurgle. Though made powerful by such mutations, these monstrosities are somewhat clumsy in their movements.

Whenever your opponent is selecting a valid target, friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED NIGHTMARE HULK** operatives cannot use **Light** terrain for **cover**. While this can allow such operatives to be targeted (assuming they're **visible**), it doesn't remove their **cover** save (if any).

Friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED NIGHTMARE HULK** operatives cannot perform unique actions. You must spend 1 additional AP for friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED NIGHTMARE HULK** operatives (excluding **VULGRAR THRICE-CURSED**) to perform the **Pick Up Marker** and mission actions (excluding **Operate Hatch**).

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Rule - REVOLTINGLY RESILIENT
The monstrous transformations wrought upon these hulking brutes have rendered their aberrant physiologies incredibly resistant to harm.

Whenever an attack dice inflicts damage of 3 or more on a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED NIGHTMARE HULK** or **GELLERPOX INFECTED MUTANT** operative, roll one D6: on a 4+, subtract 1 from that inflicted damage.

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - VULGRAR THRICE-CURSED - Spread the Glorious Gifts
Once per battle **STRATEGIC GAMBIT**. Select one objective marker this operative controls to gain one of your Techno-curse tokens. It cannot be an objective marker within control range of an enemy operative. Whenever that objective marker is within control range of an enemy operative, that operative is affected by your selected **TECHNO-CURSE** rule and an additional rule determined by your **TECHNO-CURSE**, as shown below. You cannot use this **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** while this operative is within control range of an enemy operative.
*   **Barrelwarp:** No additional effect.
*   **Screaming Rustspikes:** This **TECHNO-CURSE** inflicts 2 damage on that enemy operative (instead of 1).
*   **Viral Vox-static:** Whenever that enemy operative is activated, subtract 1 from its APL stat until the end of its activation.

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - VULGRAR THRICE-CURSED - Engineered
*At the end of the Select Operatives step, if this operative is selected for deployment, select up to two of the following improvements or weapon rules for this weapon to have for the battle: Add 1 to the Normal Dmg stat, add 1 to the Critical Dmg stat, **Balanced**, **Brutal**, **Lethal 5+**, **Rending**.

**Keywords:** GELLERPOX INFECTED, CHAOS, NIGHTMARE HULK, BLOATSPAWN

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - BLOATSPAWN - Tentacled Grasp
Whenever an enemy operative would perform the **Fall Back** action while within control range of this operative, you can use this rule. If you do, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if that enemy operative has a Wounds stat of 8 or less: on a 4+, that enemy operative cannot perform that action during that activation/counteraction (the AP spent on it isn't refunded).

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - BLOATSPAWN - Swipe
*Whenever this operative performs the **Fight** action and you select this weapon profile, if it isn't **incapacitated**, it can immediately perform a free **Fight** action afterwards, but you must select this weapon profile and it can only fight against each enemy operative within its control range once per activation or counteraction using this weapon profile. This takes precedence over action restrictions, and you can continue to perform free **Fight** actions until this operative is **incapacitated** or has fought against every enemy operative within its control range.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - FLESHSCREAMER
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 5"

**Keywords:** GELLERPOX INFECTED, CHAOS, NIGHTMARE HULK, FLESHSCREAMER

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - FLESHSCREAMER - Horrifying Shrieking
Whenever an enemy operative is within 3" of this operative, your opponent must spend 1 additional AP for that enemy operative to perform the **Pick Up Marker** and mission actions.

Whenever determining control of a marker, treat the total APL stat of enemy operatives that contest it as 1 lower if at least one of those enemy operatives is within 3" of this operative. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - LUMBERGHAST
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 5"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 20

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |

**Keywords:** GELLERPOX INFECTED, CHAOS, NIGHTMARE HULK, LUMBERGHAST

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - LUMBERGHAST - Spiked Charger

**Keywords:** GELLERPOX INFECTED, CHAOS, MUTANT

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - MUTANT - Group Activation
Whenever this operative is expended, you must then activate one other ready friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED MUTANT** operative (if able) before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal (in other words, you cannot activate more than two operatives in succession with this rule).

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - MUTANT - Gellercaust Masks
Whenever an attack dice would inflict Critical Dmg on this operative, you can choose for that attack dice to inflict Normal Dmg instead.

Whenever an operative is shooting this operative, ignore the **Piercing** weapon rule.

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - GLITCHLING - Small
This operative cannot use any weapons that aren't on its datacard, or perform unique actions.

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - GLITCHLING - Group Activation
Whenever this operative is expended, you must then activate one other ready friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED GLITCHLING** operative (if able) before your opponent activates.

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - CURSEMITE - Group Activation
Whenever this operative is expended, you must then activate one other ready friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED MUTOID VERMIN** operative (if able) before your opponent activates.

**Keywords:** GELLERPOX INFECTED, CHAOS, MUTOID VERMIN, EYESTINGER SWARM

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - EYESTINGER SWARM - Group Activation
Whenever this operative is expended, you must then activate one other ready friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED MUTOID VERMIN** operative (if able) before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal (in other words, you cannot activate more than two operatives in succession with this rule).

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - SLUDGE-GRUB

- Move: 4"
- Save: 6+
- Wounds: 2

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - SLUDGE-GRUB - Caustic Demise
When this operative is **incapacitated**, before it's removed from the killzone, roll one D6 separately for each enemy operative **visible** to and within 2" of it: on a 4+, inflict 1 damage on that operative.

### GELLERPOX INFECTED - Operatives - SLUDGE-GRUB - Group Activation
Whenever this operative is expended, you must then activate one other ready friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED MUTOID VERMIN** operative (if able) before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal (in other words, you cannot activate more than two operatives in succession with this rule).

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Strategy Ploy - PLAGUERIDDEN DETERMINATION
Nurgle's blessings cause the body to bloat and fester, bestowing an unnatural resilience upon the recipient.

Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative (excluding **MUTOID VERMIN**) that has an **Engage** order, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Strategy Ploy - BLESSINGS OF INFECTION
The mutagenic properties and corrupting influence of the Gellerpox lend the infected brutal strength and gleeful determination.

Whenever a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative is fighting or retaliating, you can do one of the following:
*   If you roll three or more fails, you can discard one of them to retain another as a normal success instead.
*   If you roll three or more successes, you can discard one of your fails to retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Strategy Ploy - DRAWN TO THE HUM
The gentle thrum of machinery has an irresistible effect upon the infected, pulling them in like insects drawn to a blazing lumen.

Select one objective marker. Whenever a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative performs the **Reposition** or **Charge** action during its activation, you can use this rule. If you do, add 1" to its Move stat until the end of that activation, but it must end that move within 2" of that objective marker.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Strategy Ploy - RUST EMANATIONS
Bloated Nightmare Hulks are redolent with infection, surrounded by a halo of foetid energy that corrodes and corrupts the weaponry of nearby assailants.

Whenever an enemy operative is within control range of friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED NIGHTMARE HULK** operatives, worsen the Hit stat of that enemy operative's weapons by 1. This isn't cumulative with being injured.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Firefight Ploy - REVOLTING TECHNOLOGY
The Gellerpox's infectious tendrils reach out to corrupt the mechanical, rendering weapons and machinery dangerous to their operators.

Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative is shooting a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative. That operative's ranged weapons have the **Hot** weapon rule until the end of that sequence; if the weapon already has that weapon rule, when your opponent rolls one D6 for that weapon rule, you can add or subtract 1 from the result. Note that for the latter you can see the result of your opponent's roll for the **Hot** weapon rule before deciding to use this ploy.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Firefight Ploy - BARGE
The enormous bodies of the Nightmare Hulks allow them to barge enemies and obstructions aside to achieve their objective.

Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED NIGHTMARE HULK** operative's activation or counteraction, before or after it performs an action. During that activation/counteraction:
*   It can move through enemy operatives and within control range of them.
*   It can perform the **Charge** and **Reposition** actions while within control range of an enemy operative, and can leave that operative's control range to do so (but then normal requirements for that move apply).

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Firefight Ploy - PUTRESCENT DEMISE
As a Gellerpox Infected perishes, their body explodes in a shower of acrid disease and hazardous gore that harms all caught in its blast.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative (excluding **MUTOID VERMIN**) is **incapacitated**, before it's removed from the killzone. Inflict 1 damage (or D3 damage instead if that friendly operative is a **NIGHTMARE HULK**) on each enemy operative **visible** to and within 2" of that friendly operative.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Firefight Ploy - FRIGHTENING ONSLAUGHT
Nightmare Hulks can strike without pause, with terrifying speed.

Use this firefight ploy after a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED NIGHTMARE HULK** operative performs the **Fight** action, if it isn't **incapacitated**. It can immediately perform a free **Fight** action (you don't have to select the same enemy operative to fight against). This takes precedence over action restrictions.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Equipment - MUTOID VERMIN
Rats, worms, insectile vermin and other foul creatures blighted by the Gellerpox swarm to fight at the side of their infected masters.

After revealing this equipment option, add four **GELLERPOX INFECTED MUTOID VERMIN** operatives to your kill team for the battle. You can select this equipment option up to twice per battle.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Equipment - POLLUTED STOCKPILE
As defenders prepare to repel the infected, they find their own weapons and equipment degraded by the Gellerpox's corroding influence.

After revealing this equipment option, roll 2D6: on a 7+, remove one of your opponent's selected equipment options; otherwise, that player removes one of their own selected equipment options. They cannot select that equipment again during the game sequence (e.g. in the Scouting step of Approved Ops). You cannot select this equipment option after the Select Operatives step.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Equipment - MUTATED SYMPTOMS
The effects of the Gellerpox are many and varied; some infected display multiple mutations, each one more grotesque than the last.

Once per battle, when you activate a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED** operative, you can select one additional **TECHNO-CURSE** for that operative to gain until the end of the turning point (it must be different from your existing **TECHNO-CURSE**). Note that if a rule refers to an enemy operative being affected by your selected **TECHNO-CURSE** rule (e.g. **VULGRAR THRICE-CURSED** operative's Spread the Glorious Gifts rule), it's affected by your additional **TECHNO-CURSE** rule too.

## GELLERPOX INFECTED - Faction Equipment - PLAGUE BELLOWS
As fusions of machine and mortal, Nightmare Hulks bristle with rusted flumes, belching exhaust pipes and wheezing bellows, all of which eject clouds of noxious fumes.

Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **GELLERPOX INFECTED NIGHTMARE HULK** operative that's more than 6" from it, you can retain one of your defence dice results of 3 as a normal success instead of discarding it.
