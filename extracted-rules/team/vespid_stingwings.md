# VESPID STINGWINGS FACTION RULES

## VESPID STINGWINGS - COMMUNION
Communion points are used to maintain the tactical focus of friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operatives. In the Ready step of each Strategy phase, you gain D3 Communion points, plus 1 if a friendly **OVERSIGHT DRONE** operative is in the killzone. Communion points are used as follows (**OVERSIGHT DRONE** operatives aren't affected by the following):

1. Whenever a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative is performing the **Shoot** action, it can only target the closest enemy operative within 8" of it (excluding enemy operatives within control range of other friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operatives) unless you spend 1 of your Communion points. For weapons with the **Blast** and **Torrent** weapon rules, only the first target must be selected in this way.
2. Whenever a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative performs the **Charge** action, it must end the action within control range of the closest enemy operative it can unless you spend 1 of your Communion points.
3. Whenever you would perform the **Pick Up Marker** or a mission action (excluding **Operate Hatch**) with a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative, you must also spend 1 of your Communion points to do so.
4. Whenever a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative is shooting, you can spend 1 (and only 1) of your Communion points to re-roll one of your attack dice.

## VESPID STINGWINGS - NEUTRON CHARGE
Neutron weapons are any weapons that have the word 'neutron' in their name, e.g. neutron blaster, neutron grenade launcher, etc. Whenever a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative moves or uses **FLY**, its neutron weapons have the **Piercing 1** weapon rule until the end of the turning point.

## VESPID STINGWINGS - FLY
Whenever a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative performs an action in which it moves, it can **FLY**. If it does, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up wholly within a distance equal to its Move stat (or 3" if it was a **Dash**) horizontally of its original location (in a killzone that uses the close quarters rules, e.g. Killzone: Gallowdark, this distance cannot be measured over or through Wall terrain, and that operative cannot be set up on the other side of an access point â€“ in other words it cannot **FLY** through an open hatchway). Note that it gains no additional distance when performing the **Charge** action. It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it's the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within control range of an enemy operative.

Roll each sequence separately in order of furthest operative to closest. The torch zone is the horizontal area between the operative's current and previous location. A 28mm round Skytorch marker can be temporarily placed underneath this operative before it moves to help determine this. **Torrent 0"** means you cannot select secondary targets outside of its torch zone, but this weapon still has the **Torrent** weapon rule for all other rules purposes, e.g. the Condensed Stronghold rule (see Killzone: Volkus, Kill Team Core Book).
