These genetically modified superhumans are made for one purpose: war.

During each friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions, a bolt pistol, boltgun or scoped bolt pistol must be selected for at least one of them.

Each friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative can counteract regardless of its order.

## In Midnight Clad
Night Lords are one with the darkness, employing it as an ally and a weapon.

Whenever an enemy operative is shooting a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative, that friendly operative is obscured if both of the following are true:
- It's more than 8" from enemy operatives it's visible to.

# Nemesis Claw Strategy Ploys

## Nemesis Claw - We Have Come For You
Whenever a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative is activated, if the first action it performs during that activation is the **Charge** action, when it ends its move during that action, you can inflict D3 damage on one enemy operative within its control range.

## Nemesis Claw - The Black Hunt
Whenever a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a wounded enemy operative, you can re-roll one of your attack dice.

## Nemesis Claw - Preysight
Whenever you're selecting a valid target for a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative, enemy operatives within 6" of it cannot use Light terrain for cover. While this can allow such operatives to be targeted (assuming they're visible), it doesn't remove their cover save (if any).

## Nemesis Claw - Return To Darkness
One friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative can immediately perform a free **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, but it must end that move with Heavy terrain within its control range, or any part of its base underneath Vantage terrain. In addition, it cannot move more than 4" during that action and it cannot end that move closer to enemy operatives (in a killzone that uses the close quarters rules, e.g. Killzone: Gallowdark, ignore Wall terrain when determining this).

# Nemesis Claw Firefight Ploys

## Nemesis Claw - Vox Scream
Use this firefight ploy when your opponent would activate an enemy operative. Your opponent cannot activate that operative during this activation. If there are no other enemy operatives eligible to be activated, this ploy has no effect. This ploy costs you 1 additional CP for each previous time you've used it during the battle (e.g. 1CP the first time you would use it, 2CP the second time, etc.).

## Nemesis Claw - Death To The False Emperor
Use this firefight ploy after rolling your attack dice for a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative, if it's shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an enemy operative that has the **Imperium** keyword. That friendly operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule until the end of that sequence; if that enemy operative also has the **Adeptus Astartes** keyword, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Relentless** weapon rule until the end of that sequence instead.

## Nemesis Claw - Proclivity For Murder
Use this firefight ploy after a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative incapacitates an enemy operative within its control range. That friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Charge** or **Dash** action (for the former, it cannot move more than 3"), even if it's performed an action that prevents it from performing those actions.

## Nemesis Claw - Dirty Fighter
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative is retaliating, at the start of the Resolve Attack Dice step. You can resolve one of your successes before the normal order. If you do, you cannot resolve any other successes during that sequence.

# Nemesis Claw Faction Equipment

## Nemesis Claw - Flayed Skin
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative within 2" of it, your opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice results of 1.

## Nemesis Claw - Chain Snare
Whenever an enemy operative would perform the **Fall Back** action while within control range of a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative, if no other enemy operatives are within that friendly operative's control range, you can use this rule. If you do, roll two D6, or one D6 if that enemy operative has a higher Wounds stat than that friendly operative. If any result is a 4+, that enemy operative cannot perform that action during that activation/counteraction (no AP are spent on it).

## Nemesis Claw - Grisly Trophy
Once per battle, when a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative incapacitates an enemy operative within 2" of it, you can use this rule. If you do, that friendly operative gains one of your Grisly Trophy tokens (if it doesn't already have one). Whenever a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative that has one of your Grisly Trophy tokens is visible to and within 2" of an enemy operative, subtract 1 from the Atk stat of that enemy operative's weapons.

## Nemesis Claw - Comms Jammers
Whenever an enemy operative is within 3" of a friendly **Nemesis Claw** operative, that enemy operative's APL stat cannot be added to. Note that this doesn't affect APL stats that have already been changed.
