- AEGIS
- BLADEMASTER
- BOMBARD
- BREACHER
- DEMOLISHER
- DISRUPTOR

Your kill team can only include each operative on this list once, and can only include up to one **GRAVIS** operative.

### Archetypes
- SEEK & DESTROY
- SECURITY

## FACTION RULES

### VETERAN ASTARTES
During each friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions and an auxiliary grenade launcher, frag cannon, heavy plasma incinerator, infernus heavy bolter, plasma pistol or stalker bolt rifle is selected for both, 1 additional AP must be spent for the second action.

Each friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative can **counteract** regardless of its order. Whenever it does, it can perform an additional 1AP action for free during that **counteraction**, but both actions must be different.

### SPECIAL ISSUE AMMUNITION
Once per turning point, when a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative is performing the **Shoot** action, in the Select Weapon step, you can use this rule. If you do, select one of the following weapon rules for that operative's ranged weapons to have until the end of the action. This rule cannot be used with explosive grenades (see universal equipment) or melta bombs.
- **Blast** 1" (you cannot select this if the weapon profile being used has the **Torrent** weapon rule)
- **Devastating** 1
- **Lethal** 5+
- **Piercing** 1
- **Rending**
- **Saturate**
- **Severe**

## STRATEGY PLOYS

### MISSION TACTICS
Select **Conceal** or **Engage**. Whenever a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative is shooting against or fighting against an enemy operative that has that order, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.

### THE LONG VIGIL
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative that's within your territory, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

### THE SHIELD THAT SLAYS
Whenever a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative is within your opponent's territory, Normal and Critical Dmg of 4 or more inflicts 1 less damage on it.

### AND THEY SHALL KNOW NO FEAR
You can ignore any changes to the stats of friendly **DEATHWATCH** operatives from being injured (including their weapons' stats).

## FIREFIGHT PLOYS

### SUFFER NOT THE ALIEN
Use this firefight ploy after rolling your attack dice for a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative, if it's shooting against or fighting against an operative that doesn't have the **CHAOS** or **IMPERIUM** keyword. You can re-roll any of your attack dice.

### AUSPICATOR TRACKING
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative is **counteracting**, before it performs any actions. You can change its order.

### ADVANCED AUSPEX SCAN
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative performs the **Shoot** action. Until the end of the activation/**counteraction**, its ranged weapons have the **Saturate** weapon rule and enemy operatives cannot be obscured.

### TRANSHUMAN PHYSIOLOGY
Use this firefight ploy when an operative is shooting a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative, in the Roll Defence Dice step. You can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## FACTION EQUIPMENT

### DIGITAL WEAPONS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative performs the **Fight** action, at the start of the Roll Attack Dice step, you can use this rule. If you do, inflict 1 damage on the enemy operative in that sequence.

### SCRUTAVORE SERVO-THRALL
Once per turning point, during a friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative's activation, you can use this rule. If you do, during that activation, that operative can perform a mission action for 1 less AP. Having an enemy operative within its control range doesn't prevent that friendly operative from performing that mission action. However, in such an instance, after it does so, you and your opponent roll-off. If your opponent wins, you cannot use this equipment for the rest of the battle.

### SANCTUS-V BIOSCRYER CUFFS
Once during each friendly **DEATHWATCH** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action, if it's not within control range of enemy operatives, you can use this rule. If you do, select one of the following:
- That friendly operative regains up to D3 lost wounds.
- Remove any changes to that friendly operative's APL stat.
- Remove one of the following tokens that friendly operative has (before that token's activation effects are resolved, if relevant): Neutron Fragment, Poison, Terrorchem.

### AMMUNITION RESERVE
Once per battle, you can use the **Special Issue Ammunition** faction rule for up to two **Shoot** actions during one turning point, but you must select different weapon rules for both uses. This takes precedence over the normal **Special Issue Ammunition** rules.
