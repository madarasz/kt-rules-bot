# HUNTER CLADE FACTION RULES

## HUNTER CLADE - DOCTRINA IMPERATIVES
Tech-Priests dictate protocols for the Hunter Clade to follow as they move through their mission, straining the programming of the Skitarii and Sicarians in order to optimise their current status, to the detriment of all else.

At the end of the Select Operatives step, select one **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** to be a Primary Mode for your kill team until the end of the battle (note that selecting a Primary Mode doesn't automatically give you the effects of that **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** for the battle; you must still select it as a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT**, as below).

**STRATEGIC GAMBIT.** Select one **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** for friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operatives to have until the Ready step of the next Strategy phase. Each **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** has both an Optimisation and a Deprecation rule. Both are in effect while your kill team has that **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE**. Once per battle, when you select the **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** that's your kill team's Primary Mode, you can ignore its Deprecation rule.

### Protector Imperative
- **Optimisation:** Friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operatives' ranged weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.
- **Deprecation:** Worsen the Hit stat of friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operatives' melee weapons by 1. This isn't cumulative with being injured.

### Conqueror Imperative
- **Optimisation:** Friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operatives' melee weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.
- **Deprecation:** Worsen the Hit stat of friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operatives' ranged weapons by 1. This isn't cumulative with being injured.

### Bulwark Imperative
- **Optimisation:** Normal Dmg of 3 or more inflicts 1 less damage on friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operatives.
- **Deprecation:** Subtract 1" from the Move stat of friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operatives.

### Aggressor Imperative
- **Optimisation:** Add 1" to the Move stat of friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operatives.
- **Deprecation:** Worsen the Save stat of friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operatives by 1.

### Neutral Imperative
- **Optimisation:** None.
- **Deprecation:** None.

# HUNTER CLADE STRATEGY PLOYS

## HUNTER CLADE - DEBILITATING IRRADIATION
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a friendly **HUNTER CLADE VANGUARD** operative, if that enemy operative is under the effects of the **Rad-Saturation** rule (see **VANGUARD** operatives), subtract 1 from the Normal Dmg stat of its weapons (to a minimum of 3).

## HUNTER CLADE - NEUROSTATIC INTERFERENCE
Whenever an enemy operative within 6" of a friendly **HUNTER CLADE INFILTRATOR** operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, your opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice.

## HUNTER CLADE - SCOUTING PROTOCOL
Each friendly **HUNTER CLADE RANGER** operative that has a **Conceal** order and is more than 6" from enemy operatives can immediately perform a free **Dash** action in an order of your choice. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

## HUNTER CLADE - ACCELERANT AGENTS
During each friendly **HUNTER CLADE RUSTSTALKER** operative's activation, it can perform two **Fight** actions, and one of them can be free.

# HUNTER CLADE FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## HUNTER CLADE - CONTROL EDICT
Use this firefight ploy when it's your turn to activate a friendly operative. Select one friendly **HUNTER CLADE LEADER** operative and one other ready friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operative visible to and within 3" of that **LEADER** operative; activate one of them as normal. When that first friendly operative you activate is expended, you can activate the other friendly operative before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal. Whenever you use this ploy, you cannot select more than one **HUNTER CLADE SICARIAN** operative.

## HUNTER CLADE - SCRAPCODE OVERLOAD
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **HUNTER CLADE INFILTRATOR** operative is activated. Alternatively, use this firefight ploy when a friendly **HUNTER CLADE INFILTRATOR** operative, or an enemy operative within 3" of that friendly operative, would perform the **Pick Up Marker** or a mission action (excluding **Operate Hatch**). Until the start of that friendly operative's next activation, whenever determining control of a marker, treat the total APL stat of enemy operatives that contest it as 1 lower if at least one of those enemy operatives is within 3" of that friendly operative. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this, and this can change control of a marker before performing the action.

## HUNTER CLADE - COMMAND OVERRIDE
Use this firefight ploy when you activate a friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operative. Select a **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** for that operative to have instead of its current one (if any) until the Ready step of the next Strategy phase.

## HUNTER CLADE - OMNISSIAH'S IMPERATIVE
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operative's activation. Alternatively, use it when an enemy operative is shooting a friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operative, at the end of the Roll Attack Dice step. Until the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, that friendly operative has an additional rule determined by its current **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** as follows:
- **Protector:** This operative's ranged weapons have the **Severe** weapon rule.
- **Conqueror:** Whenever this operative is fighting, after resolving your first attack dice during that sequence, you can immediately resolve another (before your opponent).
- **Bulwark:** Improve this operative's Save stat by 1. In addition, whenever an operative is shooting this operative, you can collect and roll an additional defence dice. If you use this ploy during a **Shoot** action, this operative's Save stat is changed immediately (this takes precedence over the core rules).
- **Aggressor:** You can ignore the first vertical distance of 2" this operative moves during one climb up.
- **Neutral:** None.

Note that you can use this ploy after rolling attack or defence dice for this operative, or before or after retaining or re-rolling those dice.

# HUNTER CLADE FACTION EQUIPMENT

## HUNTER CLADE - RAD BOMBARDMENT
Once per battle **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in any turning point after the first. Select one objective marker or your opponent's drop zone. Roll one D6 separately for each enemy operative within control range of that selected objective marker or within that drop zone, and subtract 1 if any part of that enemy operative's base is underneath Vantage terrain: on a 4+, subtract 1 from that operative's APL stat until the end of its next activation; on a 6, also inflict D3 damage on it (roll separately for each).

## HUNTER CLADE - REDUNDANCY SYSTEMS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operative is activated, if it's not within control range of enemy operatives, you can use this rule. If you do, that friendly operative regains up to D3+2 lost wounds.

## HUNTER CLADE - REFRACTOR FIELD
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operative, at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you can use this rule. If you do, worsen the x of the **Piercing** weapon rule by 1 (if any) until the end of that sequence. Note that **Piercing 1** would therefore be ignored.

## HUNTER CLADE - EXTREMIS MIND-LINK
Once per battle, you can use the **Control Edict** firefight ploy for 0CP, but instead of activating the selected friendly operatives in succession, activate them at the same time. Complete their activations action by action in any order.
