# CHAOS CULT

## CHAOS CULT COMPOSITION

Your kill team consists of:
- 1 **CULT DEMAGOGUE** operative
- 2 **BLESSED BLADE** operatives
- 9 **CHAOS DEVOTEE** operatives
- 1 **ICONARCH** operative
- 1 **MINDWITCH** operative

### Archetypes
- INFILTRATION
- SEEK & DESTROY

# CHAOS CULT FACTION RULES

## CHAOS CULT - MUTATION
During the battle, friendly **CHAOS CULT** operatives can **MUTATE** as follows:
- As a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT**, you can **MUTATE** a number of friendly **CHAOS CULT** operatives based on the turning point as follows: TP1 = 2, TP2 = 2, TP3 = 3, TP4+ = 4.
- Whenever a friendly **DEVOTEE** operative incapacitates an enemy operative within its control range, it can **MUTATE**.
- Each operative cannot **MUTATE** more than once per turning point.

Whenever a friendly operative **MUTATES**, select one of the following:
- If it's a **DEVOTEE** operative, turn it into a **MUTANT** operative.
- If it's a **MUTANT** operative, turn it into a **TORMENT** operative (max twice per turning point).
- It can regain up to D3+1 lost wounds.

You cannot have more than five **MUTANT** operatives and three **TORMENT** operatives at once. Whenever a friendly operative turns into a new operative:
- Swap the miniatures, ensuring the centre of the new miniature's base is as close as possible to where the centre of the old miniature's base was. This can put it within control range of enemy operatives, and if the old miniature was, the new miniature must be if possible.
- The new operative type loses a number of wounds equal to the lost wounds of its preceding operative type.
- It's still the same operative for any rules it's already been selected for. The operative is simply a new operative type and will use that new type's miniature and datacard rules.

## CHAOS CULT - ACCURSED GIFTS
**ACCURSED GIFTS** are rules that friendly **CHAOS CULT** operatives gain when they turn into another operative type (see Mutation faction rule). The first time a friendly **DEVOTEE** operative turns into a **MUTANT** operative during the battle, select your primary **ACCURSED GIFT**. The first time a friendly **MUTANT** operative turns into a **TORMENT** operative during the battle, select your secondary **ACCURSED GIFT**.

All friendly **MUTANT** operatives have your primary **ACCURSED GIFT**, and all friendly **TORMENT** operatives have your primary and secondary **ACCURSED GIFTS**. You cannot select the same **ACCURSED GIFT** more than once per battle.

### 1. Deformed Wings
Whenever this operative is climbing up, you can treat the vertical distance as 2" (regardless of how far the operative actually moves vertically). Whenever this operative is dropping, ignore the vertical distance.

### 2. Fleet
Add 1" to this operative's Move stat.

### 3. Chitinous
Improve this operative's Save stat by 1.

### 4. Horned
Whenever this operative ends its move during the **Charge** action, you can inflict 1 damage on one enemy operative within its control range, or D3 damage instead if this operative is a **TORMENT**.

### 5. Sinewed
You can ignore any changes to the Hit stat of this operative's melee weapons from being injured. This operative's melee weapons have the **Brutal** weapon rule.

### 6. Barbed
Whenever this operative is fighting or retaliating:
- Enemy operatives cannot assist.
- The first time you strike during that sequence, also inflict 1 damage on each other enemy operative within this operative's control range, or D3 damage instead if this operative is a **TORMENT**.

# CHAOS CULT STRATEGY PLOYS

## CHAOS CULT - EXALTATION IN PAIN
You can ignore any changes to the Hit stat of friendly **CHAOS CULT** operatives' weapons from being injured. Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **CHAOS CULT** operative that's wounded, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

## CHAOS CULT - FERVENT ONSLAUGHT
Friendly **CHAOS CULT** operatives' melee weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule, or the **Accurate 2** weapon rule if that friendly operative is a **MUTANT** or **TORMENT** operative.

## CHAOS CULT - CREATURES OF NIGHTMARE
Whenever determining control of a marker, treat the total APL stat of enemy operatives that contest it as 1 lower if at least one of those enemy operatives is within 2" of friendly **CHAOS CULT MUTANT** or **CHAOS CULT TORMENT** operatives. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.

## CHAOS CULT - SICKENING AURA
Whenever an enemy operative is within 2" of friendly **CHAOS CULT MUTANT** or **CHAOS CULT TORMENT** operatives, worsen the Hit stat of that enemy operative's weapons by 1. This isn't cumulative with being injured.

# CHAOS CULT FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## CHAOS CULT - FAITHFUL FOLLOWER
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **CHAOS CULT DARK COMMUNE** operative is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **CHAOS CULT** operative (excluding **DARK COMMUNE**) visible to and within 3" of that **DARK COMMUNE** operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being within the fighting operative's control range for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only in cover or obscured if the original target was.
This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

## CHAOS CULT - ABHORRENT MUTATION
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **CHAOS CULT** operative (excluding **DARK COMMUNE**) is activated. Select an **ACCURSED GIFT** for that operative to gain. This is in addition to any **ACCURSED GIFTS** it already has. Each friendly operative cannot be selected for this ploy more than once per battle, and if that operative turns into a different one (see Mutation faction rule), it still has that **ACCURSED GIFT**.

## CHAOS CULT - FRENZIED DEMISE
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **CHAOS CULT MUTANT** or **CHAOS CULT TORMENT** operative is incapacitated, before it's removed from the killzone. Inflict D3 damage (or D6 damage instead if that friendly operative is a **TORMENT**) on one enemy operative visible to and within 2" of that friendly operative.

## CHAOS CULT - UNLEASH THE DAEMON
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **CHAOS CULT MUTANT** or **CHAOS CULT TORMENT** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action. During that activation, that operative can perform two **Fight** actions, and one of them can be free.

# CHAOS CULT FACTION EQUIPMENT

## CHAOS CULT - BALEFUL SCRIPT
Once per battle **STRATEGIC GAMBIT**. Change one of your **ACCURSED GIFTS**. Note that if it's an **ACCURSED GIFT** an operative has from the Abhorrent Mutation firefight ploy, only that operative benefits from this.

## CHAOS CULT - COVERT GUISES
After revealing this equipment option, roll one D3. As a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in the first turning point, a number of friendly **CHAOS CULT DEVOTEE** operatives equal to the result that are wholly within your drop zone can immediately perform a free **Reposition** action, but must end that move wholly within 3" of your drop zone.

## CHAOS CULT - UNHOLY TALISMAN
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **CHAOS CULT** operative, in the Roll Defence Dice step, you can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead.

## CHAOS CULT - VILE BLESSING
Once per battle, when an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on a friendly **CHAOS CULT** operative (excluding **DEVOTEE**), you can ignore that inflicted damage. If that friendly operative is a **MUTANT** or **TORMENT** operative, you cannot roll for the Unnatural Regeneration rule for that attack dice then decide to use this rule on the same dice - you must use one or the other.
