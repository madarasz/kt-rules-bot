# Elucidian Starstriders Faction Rules

## Elucidian Starstriders - Warrant Of Trade
Up to three times per battle, you can use a **Warrant Of Trade** rule (below). Each one specifies when it can be used, and you cannot use the same **Warrant Of Trade** rule more than once per battle.

- **Consideration**
  **When:** In the Select Operatives step, after revealing your equipment options.
  **Effect:** Select one additional equipment option. It cannot be an option you have previously selected.

- **Coordinate**
  **When:** At the end of the Select Operatives step.
  **Effect:** You gain 1 additional CP.

- **Coerce**
  **When:** At the start of the Set Up Operatives step.
  **Effect:** Select one of the following options:
  - Your opponent must set up all of their equipment before you set up any.
  - You can set up all of your equipment before your opponent sets up any.
  - Your opponent must set up all of their operatives before you set up any.

- **Explore**
  **When:** Strategic Gambit in the first turning point.
  **Effect:** Perform a free **Reposition** action with one friendly **Elucidian Starstrider** operative that's wholly within your drop zone. It must end that move wholly within 3" of your drop zone.

- **Bribe**
  **When:** It's your turn to activate an operative.
  **Effect:** You can skip that activation.

- **Seize**
  **When:** In the Strategy phase, after rolling off to decide initiative.
  **Effect:** You can re-roll your dice.

- **Adaptable Terms (Approved Ops only)**
  **When:** At the end of the second turning point.
  **Effect:** Select a new tac op or a new primary op. If you select a new tac op, any points scored from the previous tac op are discarded.

## Elucidian Starstriders - Privateer Support Assets
Once per firefight phase, when a friendly **Elucidian Starstrider Navis** or **Elucidian Starstrider Elucia Vhane** operative performs the **Shoot** action, you can select one of the following **Privateer Support Asset** ranged weapons for it to use. You cannot use each **Privateer Support Asset** more than once per battle.

Whenever a friendly **Elucidian Starstrider** operative is using a **Privateer Support Asset**, determine cover saves differently. Instead, the target has a cover save if any part of its base is underneath Vantage terrain. Note that while this can affect the target's cover save, you must still select a valid target as normal. In other words, the shot is guided by an operative in the killzone, but it comes from above.
