# Death Korps Kill Team

## Death Korps Kill Team Composition

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of 14 **Death Korps** operatives selected as follows:
- 1 **Death Korps Watchmaster** operative.
- 4 **Death Korps Trooper** operatives.
- 9 **Death Korps** operatives selected from the following list:
  - **Bruiser**
  - **Confidant**
  - **Gunner**
  - **Medic**
  - **Sapper**
  - **Sniper**
  - **Spotter**
  - **Trooper**
  - **Veteran**
  - **Vox-Operator**
  - **Zealot**

Other than **Trooper** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once.

Up to four times, instead of selecting one of these **Trooper** operatives, you can select one **Death Korps** ploy to cost you 0CP for the battle.

### Archetypes
- Security, Seek & Destroy

# Death Korps Kill Team Faction Rules

## Guardsmen Orders
**Strategic Gambit** and **Support**. A friendly **Death Korps Watchmaster** operative can issue a **Guardsman Order**. Whenever it does, select one **Guardsman Order** for all friendly **Death Korps** operatives within 6" of it to receive.

Whenever a friendly operative receives a **Guardsman Order**, apply its rules until the end of the turning point. Operatives cannot benefit from more than one **Guardsman Order** at once; they only benefit from the most recent order they received during the turning point.

### Guardsmen Orders Options
- **Take Aim!:** Ranged weapons of operatives that received this order (excluding mortar barrage and remote detonator) have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.
- **Fix Bayonets!:** Melee weapons of operatives that received this order have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.
- **Dig In!:** Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly operative that's received this order, if you can retain any cover saves, you can re-roll any of your defence dice results of one result (e.g. results of 2).
- **Move! Move! Move!:** Whenever an operative that's received this order is performing the **Reposition** action, add 1" to its Move stat.

## Death Korps Kill Team - Regroup
**Support**. Select one friendly **Death Korps** operative that's more than 3" from enemy operatives. Each other friendly **Death Korps** operative within 5" of that operative and not within control range of enemy operatives can immediately perform a free **Dash** action in an order of your choice, but each that does so must end that move closer to that operative. Note that a Comms Device from universal equipment only affects the second distance of this rule. You cannot use this ploy and the Chronometer faction equipment **Strategic Gambit** in the same turning point.

# Death Korps Kill Team Firefight Ploys

## Death Korps Kill Team - In Life, Shame
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Death Korps** operative is activated and given an Engage order. It receives every **Guardsman Order**. This takes precedence over the normal rule that operatives cannot benefit from more than one **Guardsman Order** at once.

## Death Korps Kill Team - In Death, Atonement
Use this firefight ploy when a ready friendly **Death Korps** operative is incapacitated, if it isn't within control range of enemy operatives. Before it's removed from the killzone, it can immediately perform one free action. Note that friendly operative is injured for the duration of that action.

# Death Korps Kill Team Faction Equipment

## Death Korps Kill Team - Chronometer
Once per battle **Strategic Gambit** in the first or second turning point. Each friendly **Death Korps** operative wholly within your territory can immediately perform a free **Dash** action in an order of your choice, but each that does so must end that move closer to an opponent's drop zone or killzone edge. You cannot use this **Strategic Gambit** and the Regroup strategy ploy during the same turning point.

## Death Korps Kill Team - Comm-Beads
Whenever a friendly **Death Korps Watchmaster** or friendly **Death Korps Confidant** operative issues a **Guardsman Order**, you can use this rule.

| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG |
|------|-----|-----|-----|
| Hand axe | 3 | 4+ | 3/4 |

## Death Korps Kill Team - Gas Bombardment
Once per battle **Strategic Gambit**. Place your Gas marker in the killzone; it cannot be placed underneath Vantage terrain. Whenever an operative is within 3" of that marker, subtract 1 from its APL stat. In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, remove that marker. Note that an operative's APL stat is only changed while it's within 3" of that marker. If it moves more than 3" from that marker, its APL stat is no longer changed by this rule.
