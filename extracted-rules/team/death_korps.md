## DEATH KORPS - Faction Rule - GUARDSMEN ORDERS
**STRATEGIC GAMBIT** and **SUPPORT**. A friendly **DEATH KORPS WATCHMASTER** operative can issue a **GUARDSMAN ORDER**. Whenever it does, select one **GUARDSMAN ORDER** for all friendly **DEATH KORPS** operatives within 6" of it to receive.

Whenever a friendly operative receives a **GUARDSMAN ORDER**, apply its rules until the end of the turning point. Operatives cannot benefit from more than one **GUARDSMAN ORDER** at once; they only benefit from the most recent order they received during the turning point.

### DEATH KORPS - Faction Rule - GUARDSMEN ORDERS - Take Aim!
Ranged weapons of operatives that received this order (excluding mortar barrage and remote detonator) have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

### DEATH KORPS - Faction Rule - GUARDSMEN ORDERS - Fix Bayonets!
Melee weapons of operatives that received this order have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

### DEATH KORPS - Faction Rule - GUARDSMEN ORDERS - Dig In!
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly operative that's received this order, if you can retain any cover saves, you can re-roll any of your defence dice results of one result (e.g. results of 2).

### DEATH KORPS - Faction Rule - GUARDSMEN ORDERS - Move! Move! Move!
Whenever an operative that's received this order is performing the **Reposition** action, add 1" to its Move stat.

Subtract 1 from this and that operative's APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively, and if this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is incapacitated, or if it's a **Shoot** action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.

## DEATH KORPS - Firefight Ploy - IN DEATH, ATONEMENT
Use this firefight ploy when a ready friendly **DEATH KORPS** operative is incapacitated, if it isn't within control range of enemy operatives.
