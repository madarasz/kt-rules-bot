# Raveners

## Raveners Composition

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of 1 **Ravener Prime** operative and 4 **Ravener** operatives selected from the following list:
- **Felltalon**
- **Tremorscythe**
- **Venomspitter**
- **Warrior**
- **Wrecker**

Other than **Warrior** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once.

### Archetypes
- Infiltration, Seek & Destroy

# Raveners Faction Rules

## Raveners - Burrow
When setting up a **Ravener** kill team before the battle, your first two operatives must be set up as normal. Each other friendly **Ravener** operative thereafter can be set up underground: place it to one side instead of in the killzone.

In the Firefight phase, friendly **Ravener** operatives set up underground are activated and can counteract as normal. Whenever a friendly **Ravener** operative is underground, it cannot perform any actions other than **Burrow**. At the end of the battle, each friendly **Ravener** operative that's underground is **incapacitated**.

Friendly **Ravener** operatives can perform the following unique action:

### Burrow [1AP]
- If this operative is underground, set it up on your **Tunnel** in a location it can be placed (it's no longer underground, and it can be set up within control range of enemy operatives). Until the end of the activation/counteraction, subtract 2" from its Move stat.
- Alternatively, instead of resolving the above effect, if this operative is in the killzone and on your **Tunnel**, remove it from the killzone: it's now underground.
- An operative cannot perform this action while carrying a marker, or if it isn't either underground or on your **Tunnel**.

## Raveners - Tunnel
At the end of the Set Up Operatives step, place your Tunnel marker numbered '0' on the killzone floor, wholly within your drop zone and touching your killzone edge. As a Strategic Gambit in the first four turning points, you can place your next numbered Tunnel marker on the killzone floor wholly within 5" of your preceding Tunnel marker (in Killzone: Gallowdark, this distance can be measured through Wall terrain). This means that, as the battle progresses, you can have a series of sequentially numbered Tunnel markers (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). Once you have placed five Tunnel markers, don't place any more (i.e. if your battle lasts more than four turning points).

Your Tunnel markers and the area between your sequentially numbered markers (i.e. between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, etc.), create your **Tunnel**.

In a killzone that uses the hazardous areas rules (e.g. Killzone: Bheta Decima), for the purposes of the Restricted Movement rule, parts of a Tunnel marker that are touching a hazardous area are treated as a hazardous area.

## Raveners - Predatory Instincts
During each friendly **Ravener** operative's activation, it can perform two **Fight** actions.

Each friendly **Ravener** operative can counteract regardless of its order. Whenever it does:
- You can change its order first, or change its order instead of performing an action (for the latter, still treat it as having counteracted this turning point).
- During that counteraction, if it doesn't perform a mission action it can perform a free **Burrow** action.

# Raveners Operatives

## Raveners - Ravener Prime
**Stats:**
- APL: 3
- Move: 7"
- Save: 5+
- Wounds: 21

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|------|------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
| melee | Tail blade | 4 | 3+ | 3/4 | Range 3", Rending, Silent |
| melee | Scything talons & rending claws | 5 | 3+ | 4/5 | Rending |

**Abilities:**
- **Neuropredatory Crest:** Whenever determining control of a marker, treat the total APL stat of enemy operatives that contest it as 1 lower if at least one of those enemy operatives is within 3" of this operative. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this. Whenever an enemy operative is within 3" of this operative:
    - Your opponent must spend 1 additional AP for that enemy operative to perform the **Pick Up Marker** and mission actions.
    - Your opponent cannot re-roll their attack or defence dice for that operative.
- **Synaptic Link: Strategic Gambit:** If this operative isn't **incapacitated**. Roll one D6 and compare the result to the number of the current turning point; if the result is:
    - Higher: you gain 1CP.
    - Equal: nothing happens.
    - Less: inflict damage on this operative equal to the result.

| melee | Toxic scythes | 5 | 3+ | 4/5 | Lethal 5+, Shock, Poison |

**Abilities:**
- **Poison:** In the Resolve Attack Dice step, if you inflict damage with any critical successes, the operative this weapon is being used against gains one of your Poison tokens (if it doesn't already have one). Whenever an operative that has one of your Poison tokens is activated, inflict D3 damage on it.
- **Toxic Lunge [1AP]:** Select one enemy operative within 2" of this operative. Alternatively, if this operative is underground, select one enemy operative on your **Tunnel**. Inflict D3+2 damage on that enemy operative and it gains one of your Poison tokens (if it doesn't already have one). This operative can perform this action while underground (this takes precedence over the normal **Burrow** rules).

**Abilities:**
- **Subterranean Ambush:** Once per turning point, after an enemy operative performs an action in which it moves more than 2" and ends within 2" of your **Tunnel**, if this operative is underground and is either ready or hasn't counteracted during this turning point, you can interrupt that enemy operative's activation/counteraction to use this rule. If you do, activate or counteract with this operative (as appropriate), but during its activation/counteraction it must fight against or shoot against that enemy operative, and cannot do so against any other enemy operatives until it does (if this isn't possible, this operative's activation/counteraction is cancelled and this rule hasn't been used). After completing this operative's activation/counteraction, continue that enemy operative's activation/counteraction (if possible).
- **Hypersensory Hunter:** This operative can perform the **Charge** action while it has a Conceal order if it performed the **Burrow** action during the same activation/counteraction.

# Raveners Strategy Ploys

## Raveners - Death From Below
Whenever a friendly **Ravener** operative is fighting:
- If it's performed the **Burrow** action during that activation/counteraction, its melee weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.
- If it's on your **Tunnel**, its melee weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

## Raveners - Whipcord Emergence
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Ravener** operative:
- If that friendly operative has performed the **Burrow** action during that turning point, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.
- If that friendly operative is on your **Tunnel**, you can re-roll any of your defence dice.

## Raveners - Writhe Out of Sight
Select one friendly **Ravener** operative. That friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Burrow** action. If it's within 2" of your **Tunnel**, it can immediately perform a free **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action before it does so.

## Raveners - Tunnel Lurkers
Whenever a friendly **Ravener** operative is on your **Tunnel** it's in cover, unless it's within 2" of the active operative. Treat this as cover provided by Light terrain (therefore it's affected by rules that prevent this, e.g. Seek Light and Vantage terrain).

# Raveners Firefight Ploys

## Raveners - Slithering Evasion
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Ravener** operative's activation or counteraction, before or after it performs an action. During that activation/counteraction, that operative can:
- Perform the **Fall Back** action for 1 less AP.
- Perform the **Charge** action while within control range of an enemy operative, and can leave that operative's control range to do so (but then normal requirements for that move apply).

## Raveners - Subterranean Horror
Use this firefight ploy when an enemy operative is performing the **Fight** action and selects a friendly **Ravener** operative on your **Tunnel** to fight against. In the Resolve Attack Dice step of that sequence, you resolve the first attack dice (i.e. defender instead of attacker).

## Raveners - Burrowing Strike
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Ravener** operative performs the **Burrow** action. Before that operative is removed from the killzone, or after setting it up on your **Tunnel**, inflict D3+1 damage on each enemy operative within its control range (roll separately for each). You cannot use this ploy in the Strategy phase, or during a **Felltalon** operative's activation or counteraction if it performs the **Toxic Lunge** action (and vice versa).

## Raveners - Death Frenzy
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Ravener** operative is **incapacitated**. Before that operative is removed from the killzone, inflict D3 damage on each enemy operative within its control range (roll separately for each). If that friendly operative is a **Venomspitter** that's currently benefitting from the effects of its **Distend Dorsal Sac** action, inflict 2D3 damage instead.

# Raveners Faction Equipment

## Raveners - Chromatospore Camouflage
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Ravener** operative, if you can retain any cover saves, you can retain one additional cover save. This isn't cumulative with improved cover saves from Vantage terrain.

## Raveners - Acid Blood
Whenever a friendly **Ravener** operative is fighting or retaliating, whenever an attack dice inflicts damage on it, roll one D6: on a 5+, inflict 1 damage on the enemy operative in that sequence.

## Raveners - Metamorphic Flesh
Whenever a friendly **Ravener** operative is activated, it regains up to D3 lost wounds.

## Raveners - Heightened Senses
Once per battle, after rolling off to decide initiative, if a friendly **Ravener** operative is underground and an enemy operative is within 5" of your **Tunnel**, you can re-roll your dice.

# Raveners Rules Commentary
[FAQ]
*Question*: Are **Ravener** operatives underground considered 'in the killzone' for the second victory points paragraph of the Implant tac op?
*Answer*: Yes. Note that other tac ops (e.g. Surveillance) would still require those operatives to be in the killzone.

[FAQ]
*Question*: Can an expended friendly **Tremorscythe** operative counteract to interrupt an enemy operative's activation with the Subterranean Ambush rule if there are still other ready friendly **Ravener** operatives?
*Answer*: Yes.
---
[FAQ]
*Question*: When my **Tremorscythe** operative interrupts my opponent's activation, if the enemy operative is incapacitated (and therefore its activation cannot be continued), who activates next? Equally, if it isn't incapacitated and then continues its activation, who activates next?
*Answer*: Your opponent in both cases, as the **Tremorscythe** operative has used your activation.
