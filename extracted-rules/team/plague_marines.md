# Plague Marines Faction Rules

## Astartes
Space Marines are genetically augmented transhumans forged for only one purpose: war.

During each friendly **Plague Marine** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions, a bolt pistol, boltgun or **Psychic** weapon must be selected for at least one of them. You cannot select the same **Psychic** ranged weapon more than once per activation.

Each friendly **Plague Marine** operative can **counteract** regardless of its order.

## Poison
Nurgle deals in warp-tainted poisons, toxins, viral plagues and sicknesses of the soul that defy both natural resilience and medical intervention.

Some weapons in this team's rules have the Poison weapon rule.

***Poison:** In the Resolve Attack Dice step, if you inflict damage with any successes, the operative this weapon is being used against (excluding friendly **Plague Marine** operatives) gains one of your Poison tokens (if it doesn't already have one). Whenever an operative that has one of your Poison tokens is activated, inflict 1 damage on it.

## Disgustingly Resilient
The followers of Nurgle possess extreme resilience to bullet and blade, for their hideous forms are swollen by death, decay and disease.

Whenever an attack dice inflicts damage of 3 or more on a friendly **Plague Marine** operative, roll one D6: on a 4+, subtract 1 from that inflicted damage.

# Plague Marines Strategy Ploys

## Plague Marines - Contagion
Subtract 2" from the Move stat of an enemy operative and worsen the Hit stat of its weapons by 1 (this isn't cumulative with being injured) whenever any of the following are true:
- It has one of your Poison tokens and is visible to (or vice versa) and within 3" of friendly **Plague Marine** operatives.
- It's visible to (or vice versa) and within 3" of a friendly **Plague Marine Icon Bearer** operative.

## Plague Marines - Lumbering Death
Whenever a friendly **Plague Marine** operative is shooting or fighting during an activation in which it hasn't moved more than 3", or whenever it's retaliating, its weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

## Plague Marines - Cloud of Flies
Place one of your Cloud of Flies markers in the killzone. Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Plague Marine** operative that's more than 3" from it, if that friendly operative is wholly within 1" of that marker, that friendly operative is obscured. In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, remove that marker.

## Plague Marines - Nurglings
Select one enemy operative within 3" of a friendly **Plague Marine** operative, or one enemy operative that has one of your Poison tokens and is within 7" of a friendly **Plague Marine** operative. Until the end of the selected operative's next activation, subtract 1 from its APL stat.

# Plague Marines Firefight Ploys

## Plague Marines - Virulent Poison
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Plague Marine** operative's activation or counteraction, before or after it performs an action. Select one of the following:
- One enemy operative within 3" of that operative gains one of your Poison tokens (if it doesn't already have one).
- Roll 2D6: if the result is 7+, one enemy operative within 7" of that operative gains one of your Poison tokens (if it doesn't already have one).

## Plague Marines - Poisonous Demise
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Plague Marine** operative is **incapacitated**, before it's removed from the killzone. Each enemy operative visible to and within 3" of that operative gains one of your Poison tokens (if they don't already have one); for each of those enemy operatives that already has one of your Poison tokens (including if they gained one during this action), inflict 1 damage on them instead.

## Plague Marines - Sickening Resilience
Use this firefight ploy when an attack dice inflicts damage on a friendly **Plague Marine** operative. Until the end of the activation or counteraction, for the purposes of the Disgustingly Resilient rule for that operative, always subtract 1 from the damage inflicted (to a minimum of 2) – you don't need to roll.

## Plague Marines - Curse of Rot
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Plague Marine** operative is fighting against or shooting against an enemy operative within 3" of it (or within 7" of it if that enemy operative has one of your Poison tokens), after your opponent rolls their attack or defence dice. For each result of 3 they roll, inflict 1 damage on that enemy operative, that result cannot be retained as a success and they cannot re-roll it.

# Plague Marines Faction Equipment

## Plague Marines - Plague Bells
You can ignore any changes to the stats of friendly **Plague Marine** operatives from being injured (including their weapons' stats).

## Plague Marines - Blight Grenades
Friendly **Plague Marine** operatives have the following ranged weapon (you cannot select it for use more than twice during the battle):

| Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
| Blight grenade | 4 | 4+ | 2/4 | Range 6", Blast 2", Saturate, Severe, Poison* |

## Plague Marines - Plague Rounds
Friendly **Plague Marine** operatives' boltguns and bolt pistols have the **Poison** and **Severe** weapon rules.

## Plague Marines - Poison Vents
Whenever an enemy operative that has one of your Poison tokens is activated within 3" of a friendly **Plague Marine** operative, inflict D3 damage on it (instead of the normal 1).
