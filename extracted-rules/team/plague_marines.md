## PLAGUE MARINES - Archetypes
- SECURITY
- SEEK & DESTROY

## PLAGUE MARINES - Faction Rule - ASTARTES
Space Marines are genetically augmented transhumans forged for only one purpose: war.

During each friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions, a bolt pistol, boltgun or **PSYCHIC** weapon must be selected for at least one of them. You cannot select the same **PSYCHIC** ranged weapon more than once per activation.

Each friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operative can **counteract** regardless of its order.

## PLAGUE MARINES - Faction Rule - POISON
Some weapons in this team's rules have the Poison weapon rule.

***Poison:** In the Resolve Attack Dice step, if you inflict damage with any successes, the operative this weapon is being used against (excluding friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operatives) gains one of your Poison tokens (if it doesn't already have one). Whenever an operative that has one of your Poison tokens is activated, inflict 1 damage on it.

## PLAGUE MARINES - Faction Rule - DISGUSTINGLY RESILIENT
Whenever an attack dice inflicts damage of 3 or more on a friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operative, roll one D6: on a 4+, subtract 1 from that inflicted damage.

Whenever a friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operative is shooting or fighting during an activation in which it hasn't moved more than 3", or whenever it's retaliating, its weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

## PLAGUE MARINES - Strategy Ploy - CLOUD OF FLIES
Place one of your Cloud of Flies markers in the killzone. Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operative that's more than 3" from it, if that friendly operative is **wholly within 1"** of that marker, that friendly operative is **obscured**.

Select one enemy operative within 3" of a friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operative, or one enemy operative that has one of your Poison tokens and is within 7" of a friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operative. Until the end of the selected operative's next activation, subtract 1 from its APL stat.

## PLAGUE MARINES - Firefight Ploy - POISONOUS DEMISE
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operative is **incapacitated**, before it's removed from the killzone.

## PLAGUE MARINES - Firefight Ploy - SICKENING RESILIENCE
Use this firefight ploy when an attack dice inflicts damage on a friendly **PLAGUE MARINE** operative. Until the end of the activation or counteraction, for the purposes of the **Disgustingly Resilient** rule for that operative, always subtract 1 from the damage inflicted (to a minimum of 2) – you don't need to roll.
