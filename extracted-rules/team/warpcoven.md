# WARPCOVEN

## KILL TEAM COMPOSITION

### Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of 6 **WARPCOVEN** operatives selected from the following list:
- SORCERER OF DESTINY
- SORCERER OF TEMPYRION
- SORCERER OF WARPFIRE
- RUBRIC MARINE GUNNER with one of the following options:
    - Warpflamer; fists
    - Soulreaper cannon; fists
- RUBRIC MARINE ICON BEARER
- RUBRIC MARINE WARRIOR
- TZAANGOR CHAMPION with one of the following options:
    - Greataxe
    - Greatblade
- TZAANGOR HORN BEARER
- TZAANGOR ICON BEARER
- TZAANGOR WARRIOR with one of the following options:
    - Tzaangor blades
    - Tzaangor blade & shield
    - Autopistol; chainsword

You must select at least one friendly **SORCERER** operative, and one of your selected **SORCERER** operatives must have the **LEADER** keyword for the battle. Add 1 to that **LEADER** operative’s Wounds stat for the battle.

Other than **WARRIOR** and **GUNNER** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. Your kill team can only include up to two **GUNNER** operatives. Your kill team can only include up to one warpflame pistol and up to one soulreaper cannon.

**TZAANGOR CHAMPION**, **TZAANGOR HORN BEARER**, **TZAANGOR ICON BEARER**, and **TZAANGOR WARRIOR** operatives count as half a selection each, meaning you can select both of them and it’s treated as one selection in total.

All Sorcerers must be equipped with a force stave, the **PSYCHIC** weapons on their datacard, and one of the following options: Inferno bolt pistol, Prosperine khopesh, or Warpflame pistol.

## FACTION RULES

### BOONS OF TZEENTCH
Whenever you select a **SORCERER** operative for the battle, you must select a **BOON OF TZEENTCH** for it to have for the battle. You cannot select each **BOON OF TZEENTCH** more than once per battle.

- **Incorporeal Sight:** This operative's ranged weapons have the **Saturate** weapon rule. Whenever this operative is shooting, enemy operatives cannot be obscured.
- **Time-Walk:** Add **1"** to this operative's Move stat.
- **Echoes from the Warp:** Once per battle, when you counteract with this operative, you can change its order, and it can perform an additional 1AP action for free during that counteraction, but both actions must be different.
- **Warp Swell:** Add 1 to the Normal Dmg stat of this operative's melee weapons.
- **Mutant Appendage:** Having an enemy operative within this operative's control range doesn't prevent it from performing the **Pick Up Marker** or mission actions. Once per activation, this operative can perform the **Pick Up Marker**, **Place Marker** or a mission action for 1 less AP.
- **Immaterial Flight:** Once per turning point, when this operative is performing the **Charge** or **Reposition** action during its activation, it can **FLY**. If it does, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up wholly within a distance equal to its Move stat horizontally of its original location. It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it's the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within control range of an enemy operative. Note that it gains no additional distance when performing the **Charge** action.
- **Twist of Fate:** This operative's **PSYCHIC** ranged weapons have the **Piercing Crits 1** weapon rule.
- **Astral Bombardment:** Select one of this operative's **PSYCHIC** ranged weapons. That weapon has the **Devastating 1** weapon rule. If you select a doombolt, it has the **2" Devastating 2** weapon rule instead of **Devastating 2**. If you select firestorm or mindburn (**SORCERER OF WARPFIRE**), whenever that operative performs the **Shoot** action, select the **Seek Light** or **Devastating 1** weapon rule for that weapon to have until the end of the action (it cannot have both).
- **Master of the Immaterium:** Add 3" to the distance requirements of this operative's **PSYCHIC** actions that have a distance requirement. Note that for the **SORCERER OF TEMPYRION's Temporal Flux** action, this boon only affects the distance in the first effect of that rule.

### ASTARTES
- During each friendly **WARPCOVEN HERETIC ASTARTES** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions and a soulreaper cannon or a warpflamer is selected for both, 1 additional AP must be spent for the second action. You cannot select the same **PSYCHIC** ranged weapon more than once per activation.
- Each friendly **WARPCOVEN HERETIC ASTARTES** operative can counteract regardless of its order.

If that operative isn't wholly within 6" of your Temporal Flux marker (including if it's **incapacitated**), remove that marker from the killzone. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative, or if your Temporal Flux marker is currently in the killzone.

## STRATEGY PLOYS

### AETHERIAL WARDING
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **WARPCOVEN** operative, weapons with the **Piercing 1** weapon rule have the **Piercing Crits 1** weapon rule instead.

### FATE ITSELF IS MY WEAPON
Roll two D6 and reserve them (put them to one side). In the following Firefight phase, whenever an operative is shooting, fighting or retaliating, after you or your opponent roll their attack dice, but before re-rolls, you can use one of your reserved dice to replace one of the D6 rolled for that sequence (yours or your opponent's); that replacement dice cannot be re-rolled or retained as a success or critical success if it's not, and is discarded at the end of that sequence. Then, if the combined result of both reserved dice was less than 9, discard the other dice. You cannot use more than one reserved dice per sequence. Discard any remaining reserved dice at the end of the turning point.

### BROTHERHOOD OF SORCERERS
Friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operatives' **PSYCHIC** weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule if another friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operative is within 6" of that operative.

### SAVAGE HERD
Friendly **WARPCOVEN TZAANGOR** operatives' melee weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule. Whenever a friendly **WARPCOVEN TZAANGOR** operative is assisted by a friendly **WARPCOVEN** operative, or is fighting while visible to and within 6" of a friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operative, that friendly **WARPCOVEN TZAANGOR** operative's melee weapons also have the **Severe** weapon rule.

## FIREFIGHT PLOYS

### ALL IS DUST
Use this firefight ploy when an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on a friendly **WARPCOVEN RUBRIC MARINE** operative. That attack dice inflicts 1 damage instead.

### CAPRICIOUS PLAN
Use this firefight ploy at the end of a friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operative's activation. That friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action (even if it's performed an action that prevents it from performing the **Dash** action), or you can change its order instead.

### PSYCHIC CABAL
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operative is activated. Select one other friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operative visible to and within 6" of that operative, then select one of that other friendly operative's **PSYCHIC** unique actions or **PSYCHIC** ranged weapons for that first friendly operative to have until the end of its activation. You cannot select a **PSYCHIC** ranged weapon that has been used by that other friendly operative during this turning point, and that other friendly operative cannot use the selected weapon during this turning point.

### MUTANT HERD
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **WARPCOVEN TZAANGOR** operative is activated. Select one other ready friendly **WARPCOVEN TZAANGOR** operative visible to and within 2" of it to activate at the same time. Complete their activations action by action in any order.

## FACTION EQUIPMENT

### ENSORCELLED ROUNDS
Friendly **WARPCOVEN** operatives' inferno boltguns, inferno bolt pistols and autopistols have the **Devastating 1** weapon rule.

### DAEMONMAW WEAPONS
Add 1 to the Atk stat of friendly **WARPCOVEN RUBRIC MARINE** operatives' melee weapons. Whenever a friendly **WARPCOVEN RUBRIC MARINE** operative is retaliating, its melee weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule.

### ARCANE ROBES
Once per turning point, whenever an attack dice would inflict Critical Dmg on a friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operative, you can use this rule. If you do, that attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg instead.

### SORCEROUS SCROLLS
Once per battle, when a friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operative is activated or counteracts, you can select a different **BOON OF TZEENTCH** for it to have until the end of the battle (it loses any it previously had). It cannot be the same **BOON OF TZEENTCH** any other friendly operative has. Note that if you use this rule when a friendly operative counteracts and you select **Echoes from the Warp**, it can be used immediately to change the operative's order and perform a free action during that counteraction.
