## WARPCOVEN - Operative Selection
6 **WARPCOVEN** operatives selected from the following list:
- **SORCERER OF DESTINY**
- **SORCERER OF TEMPYRION**
- **SORCERER OF WARPFIRE**
- **RUBRIC MARINE GUNNER** with one of the following options:
    - Warpflamer; fists
    - Soulreaper cannon; fists

    - Greataxe
    - Greatblade
- **TZAANGOR HORN BEARER**
- **TZAANGOR ICON BEARER**
- **TZAANGOR WARRIOR** with one of the following options:
    - Tzaangor blades
    - Tzaangor blade & shield
    - Autopistol; chainsword

You must select at least one friendly **SORCERER** operative, and one of your selected **SORCERER** operatives must have the **LEADER** keyword for the battle. Add 1 to that **LEADER** operative's Wounds stat for the battle. Other than **WARRIOR** and **GUNNER** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. Your kill team can only include up to two **GUNNER** operatives.

**SORCERER** operatives must be equipped with a force stave, **PSYCHIC** weapons on their datacard and one of the following options:
- Inferno bolt pistol
- Prosperine khopesh
- Warpflame pistol

Your kill team can only include up to one warpflame pistol and up to one soulreaper cannon.

**TZAANGOR CHAMPION**, **TZAANGOR HORN BEARER**, **TZAANGOR ICON BEARER** and **TZAANGOR WARRIOR** operatives count as half a selection each, meaning you can select both of them and it's treated as one selection in total.

## WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH
Warpcoven Sorcerers are dedicated followers of Tzeentch, and have earned many great boons from their patron deity, from beneficial mutations to diabolical knowledge.

Whenever you select a **SORCERER** operative for the battle, you must select a **BOON OF TZEENTCH** (below) for it to have for the battle. You cannot select each **BOON OF TZEENTCH** more than once per battle.

### WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH - Incorporeal Sight
This operative's ranged weapons have the **Saturate** weapon rule. Whenever this operative is shooting, enemy operatives cannot be **obscured**.

### WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH - Time-Walk
Add 1" to this operative's Move stat.

### WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH - Echoes from the Warp
Once per battle, when you counteract with this operative, you can change its order, and it can perform an additional 1AP action for free during that counteraction, but both actions must be different.

### WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH - Warp Swell
Add 1 to the Normal Dmg stat of this operative's melee weapons.

### WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH - Mutant Appendage
Having an enemy operative within this operative's **control range** doesn't prevent it from performing the **Pick Up Marker** or mission actions. Once per activation, this operative can perform the **Pick Up Marker**, **Place Marker** or a mission action for 1 less AP.

### WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH - Immaterial Flight
Once per turning point, when this operative is performing the **Charge** or **Reposition** action during its activation, it can **FLY**. If it does, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up **wholly within** a distance equal to its Move stat horizontally of its original location. In a killzone that uses the close quarters rules (e.g. Killzone: Gallowdark), this distance cannot be measured over or through Wall terrain, and that operative cannot be set up on the other side of an access point (in other words, it cannot **FLY** through an open hatchway). Note that it gains no additional distance when performing the **Charge** action. It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it's the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within **control range** of an enemy operative.

### WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH - Twist of Fate
This operative's **PSYCHIC** ranged weapons have the **Piercing Crits 1** weapon rule.

### WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH - Astral Bombardment
Select one of this operative's **PSYCHIC** ranged weapons. That weapon has the **Devastating 1** weapon rule. If you select a doombolt, it has the 2" **Devastating 2** weapon rule instead of **Devastating 2**. If you select firestorm or mindburn (**SORCERER OF WARPFIRE**), whenever that operative performs the **Shoot** action, select the **Seek Light** or **Devastating 1** weapon rule for that weapon to have until the end of the action (it cannot have both).

### WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - BOONS OF TZEENTCH - Master of the Immaterium
Add 3" to the distance requirements of this operative's **PSYCHIC** actions that have a distance requirement. Note that for the **SORCERER OF TEMPYRION**'s **Temporal Flux** action, this boon only affects the distance in the first effect of that rule.

## WARPCOVEN - Faction Rule - ASTARTES
During each friendly **WARPCOVEN HERETIC ASTARTES** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions and a soulreaper cannon or a warpflamer is selected for both, 1 additional AP must be spent for the second action. You cannot select the same **PSYCHIC** ranged weapon more than once per activation.

Each friendly **WARPCOVEN HERETIC ASTARTES** operative can counteract regardless of its order.

### WARPCOVEN - Operatives - SORCERER OF WARPFIRE - Mindburn
In the Resolve Attack Dice step, if you inflict damage with any critical successes, the operative this weapon is being used against gains one of your Mindburn tokens (if it doesn't already have one) until the end of its next activation, until it's **incapacitated** or until a friendly operative uses this weapon again (whichever comes first).

Then, if the combined result of both reserved dice was less than 9, discard the other dice. You cannot use more than one reserved dice per sequence.

## WARPCOVEN - Firefight Ploy - PSYCHIC CABAL
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operative is activated.

## WARPCOVEN - Faction Equipment - SORCEROUS SCROLLS
Once per battle, when a friendly **WARPCOVEN SORCERER** operative is activated or counteracts, you can select a different **BOON OF TZEENTCH** for it to have until the end of the battle (it loses any it previously had). It cannot be the same **BOON OF TZEENTCH** any other friendly operative has. This takes precedence over the normal **Boons of Tzeentch** rules.
