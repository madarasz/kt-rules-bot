# Legionaries Faction Rules

## Legionaries - Marks of Chaos
Whenever you select a **Legionary** operative for the battle, you must select one of the following keywords for it to have for that battle: **Khorne**, **Nurgle**, **Slaanesh**, **Tzeentch**, **Undivided**. Each operative's keyword can be different, but a **Balefire Acolyte** operative cannot have the **Khorne** keyword.

Friendly **Legionary** operatives have an additional rule determined by this keyword. In addition, **Legionary** ploys have additional benefits for operatives with the relevant keyword.

## Legionaries - Khorne
**Wrathful Onslaught:** This operative's melee weapons have the **Severe** weapon rule.

## Legionaries - Nurgle
**Disgusting Vigour:** Whenever Normal Dmg of 3 or more is inflicted on this operative, roll one D6: on a 5+, subtract 1 from that inflicted damage.

## Legionaries - Slaanesh
**Unnatural Agility:** Add 1" to this operative's Move stat.

## Legionaries - Tzeentch
**Empyreal Guidance:** This operative's ranged weapons have the **Severe** weapon rule.

## Legionaries - Undivided
**Vicious Reavers:** Whenever this operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against an enemy operative within 6" of it, this operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

## Legionaries - Astartes
During each friendly **Legionary** operative's activation, it can perform either two **Shoot** actions or two **Fight** actions. If it's two **Shoot** actions, a bolt pistol, boltgun or tainted bolt pistol must be selected for at least one of them.

Each friendly **Legionary** operative can **counteract** regardless of its order.

# Legionaries Strategy Ploys

## Legionaries - Blood For The Blood God
Whenever a friendly **Legionary** operative (excluding **Khorne**) is fighting, the first time you strike during that sequence, inflict 1 additional damage (to a maximum of 7).

Add 1 to both Dmg stats of friendly **Legionary Khorne** operatives' melee weapons (to a maximum of 7).

## Legionaries - Implacable
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Legionary** operative, weapons with the **Piercing 1** weapon rule have the **Piercing Crits 1** weapon rule instead.

You can ignore any changes to the stats of friendly **Legionary Nurgle** operatives from being injured (including their weapons' stats).

## Legionaries - Quicksilver Speed
Whenever a friendly **Legionary** operative that performed an action in which it moved during this turning point is fighting, worsen the Hit stat of the enemy operative's melee weapons by 1.

Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **Legionary Slaanesh** operative more than 6" from it that performed an action in which it moved during this turning point, worsen the Hit stat of the enemy operative's weapons by 1.

In all cases for this ploy, this isn't cumulative with being injured.

## Legionaries - Fickle Fates
Whenever a friendly **Legionary** operative is shooting a ready enemy operative, that friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Balanced** weapon rule.

Whenever an operative is shooting a ready friendly **Legionary Tzeentch** operative, in the Roll Defence Dice step, if you retain any critical successes, you can retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it.

# Legionaries Firefight Ploys

## Legionaries - Unending Bloodshed
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Legionary Khorne** operative is incapacitated while fighting or retaliating. You can strike the enemy operative in that sequence with one of your unresolved successes before it's removed from the killzone.

## Legionaries - Mutability And Change
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Legionary Tzeentch** operative is activated. Until the end of that operative's activation, add 1 to its APL stat. If it's a **Warrior** operative, that operative's Marks of Chaos keyword cannot be changed during this turning point (see Infernal Pact additional rule).

## Legionaries - Malignant Aura
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **Legionary Nurgle** operative is performing the **Shoot** action, when you select a valid target. Until the end of that action, whenever that friendly operative is shooting an enemy operative within 3" of it (i.e. including secondary targets, if any), that friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Piercing 1** weapon rule.

## Legionaries - Sickening Captivation
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **Legionary Slaanesh** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action. Select one enemy operative visible to and within 4" of that friendly operative. Until the end of that enemy operative's next activation, subtract 1 from its APL stat.

# Legionaries Faction Equipment

## Legionaries - Warded Armour
Strategic Gambit. Select one friendly **Legionary** operative. Until the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, change that operative's Save stat to 2+.

## Legionaries - Tainted Rounds
Once per turning point, when a friendly **Legionary** operative is performing the **Shoot** action and you select a bolt pistol or boltgun, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that action, that weapon has the **Rending** weapon rule.

## Legionaries - Chaos Talismans
Strategic Gambit. Select one Marks of Chaos keyword. Once during each of their activations, when a friendly **Legionary** operative that has that keyword is shooting, fighting or retaliating, if you roll two or more fails, you can inflict D3 damage on that friendly operative to discard one of them and retain the other as a normal success instead. Note that if it's the **Shoot** action and that damage incapacitates that friendly operative, the action doesn't end (continue the sequence with your successful attack dice).

## Legionaries - Malefic Blades
Friendly **Legionary** operatives have the following melee weapon for the battle:

| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|------|------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
