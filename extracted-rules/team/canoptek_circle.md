# CANOPTEK CIRCLE FACTION RULES

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - OBELISK NODE MATRIX
As a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in the first turning point, place your three **OBELISK NODE** markers wholly within your territory.

As a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in each turning point after the first, you can move your **OBELISK NODE** markers up to 3" each.

Your **OBELISK NODE** markers control other markers within 1" of them that no enemy operatives contest (treat your **OBELISK NODE** markers as friendly operatives for this purpose). If more than one player would use their **OBELISK NODE** markers to control the same marker, no **OBELISK NODE** markers control it.

Whenever one of your **OBELISK NODE** markers is within 6" horizontally of another of your **OBELISK NODE** markers, those markers and the area between them create an **OBELISK NODE MATRIX** above and below (in other words, their height in the killzone is irrelevant). If all three of your **OBELISK NODE** markers fulfil this, it creates a larger combined **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**.

Whenever a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative is within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**:
* Weapons on its datacard have the **Accurate 2** weapon rule.
* Add 1 to its APL stat.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - GEOMANCER
**Stats:**
- APL: 3
- Move: 6"
- Save: 3+
- Wounds: 14

**Weapons:**
| Type  | Name                      | ATK | HIT | DMG   | Weapon Rules                  |
|-------|---------------------------|-----|-----|-------|-------------------------------|
| melee | Tremorglaive (part matter)| 4   | 3+  | 4/5   | **Piercing 1**, **Piercing Crits 2** |
| melee | Tremorglaive (quake)      | 6   | 3+  | 1/3   | **Blast 2"**, **Seek Light**, **Stun** |
| melee | Tremorglaive (sweep)      | 4   | 4+  | 4/5   | **Severe**, **Shock**, **Stun** |

**Abilities:**
- **Obelisk Node Control:** Whenever this operative would perform a mission action, if it requires this operative to control an objective marker, you can instead determine control from one of your **OBELISK NODE** markers (see Obelisk Node Matrix faction rule). Whenever this operative would perform the **Operate Hatch** action, you can open or close a hatchway that's access point is within 1" of one of your **OBELISK NODE** markers instead. Note that you must still fulfil the **Operate Hatch** action's conditions.

**Actions:**
- **GEOMANTIC DISTURBANCE [1AP]:** Select a point on a terrain feature; that point must be visible to and within 8" of this operative. Separately roll 2D6 for each operative within 2" of that point. If the result is higher than that operative's remaining wounds, inflict damage on it equal to the difference. This operative cannot perform this action while it has a **Conceal** order, or while within control range of an enemy operative.
- **CANOPTEK CONTROL [1AP]:** **SUPPORT**. Select one friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE CANOPTEK** operative visible to and within 6" of this operative. Alternatively, you can select one friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE CANOPTEK** operative that's visible to this operative and within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX** (**SUPPORT** doesn't apply to this selection). That selected operative can immediately perform a 1AP action for free; it cannot move more than 2" during that action. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.
- **MOLECULAR BREACH [1AP]:** **SUPPORT**. Select one friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative visible to and within 6" of this operative. Alternatively, you can select one friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative visible to this operative and within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX** (**SUPPORT** doesn't apply to this selection). The next time the selected operative performs an action in which it moves, don't move it. Instead, remove it from the killzone and set it back up wholly within a distance equal to its Move stat (or 3" if it was a **Dash**) horizontally of its original location (in a killzone that uses the close quarters rules, e.g. Killzone: Tomb World, this distance can be measured over and through Wall terrain and the operative can be set up on the other side). Note that it gains no additional distance when performing the **Charge** action. It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it's the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within control range of an enemy operative. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - CANOPTEK MACROCYTE ACCELERATOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 7"
- Save: 4+
- Wounds: 17

**Weapons:**
| Type   | Name          | ATK | HIT | DMG   | Weapon Rules         |
|--------|---------------|-----|-----|-------|----------------------|

| melee  | Claws & spark | 3   | 4+  | 3/4   | **Lethal 5+**, **Stun** |

**Actions:**
- **CRANIAL OVERLOAD [1AP]:** Select one enemy operative visible to and within 3" of this operative. Alternatively, if this operative is within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, you can select one enemy operative within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**. Until the end of that enemy operative's next activation, subtract 1 from its APL stat. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.
- **OVERCHARGE [1AP]:** Select one other friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE CANOPTEK** operative visible to and within 3" of this operative. Alternatively, if this operative is within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, you can select one other friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE CANOPTEK** operative within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**. Until the end of that selected operative's next activation, add 1 to its APL stat. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - CANOPTEK MACROCYTE REANIMATOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 7"
- Save: 4+
- Wounds: 17

**Weapons:**
| Type   | Name          | ATK | HIT | DMG   | Weapon Rules          |
|--------|---------------|-----|-----|-------|-----------------------|
| ranged | Atomiser beam | 4   | 4+  | 3/4   | **Range 6"**, **Lethal 5+** |
| melee  | Claws & tail  | 4   | 4+  | 3/4   |                       |

**Abilities:**
- **Reanimate:** Once per turning point, when another friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLES** operative would be **incapacitated**, if that operative is visible to and within 6" of this operative, or if this and that operative are within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within control range of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn't **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action. If this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is **incapacitated**, or if it's a **Shoot** action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.

**Actions:**
- **NANOSCARAB BEAM [1AP]:** Select one friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLES** operative visible to and within 6" of this operative. Alternatively, if this operative is within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, you can select one other friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**. The selected operative regains up to 3D3 lost wounds. It cannot be an operative that the **Reanimate** rule was used on during this turning point. This operative cannot perform this action while within control range of an enemy operative.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - CANOPTEK MACROCYTE WARRIOR
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 7"
- Save: 4+
- Wounds: 7

**Weapons:**
| Type   | Name                        | ATK | HIT | DMG   | Weapon Rules   |
|--------|-----------------------------|-----|-----|-------|----------------|
| ranged | Gauss scalpel               | 4   | 4+  | 3/4   | **Piercing 1** |
| ranged | Tesla caster (focused)      | 5   | 4+  | 2/3   |                |
| ranged | Tesla caster (living lightning) | 5   | 4+  | 2/3   | **Blast 2"** |
| melee  | Claws & tail                | 4   | 4+  | 3/4   |                |

**Abilities:**
- **Aggressive Defence:** If this operative is **incapacitated** by an enemy operative within 2" of it, before this operative is removed from the killzone, roll one D3: on a 2+, inflict damage on that enemy operative equal to the result.
- **Expendable Construct:** This operative is ignored for your opponent's kill/elimination op (when it's **incapacitated**, and when determining your starting number of operatives). It's also ignored for victory conditions and scoring VPs if either require operatives to 'escape', 'survive or be incapacitated by enemy operatives (if it escapes/survives/is incapacitated, determining how many operatives must escape/survive/be incapacitated, etc.).
- **A Ceaseless Scuttling:** As a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in each turning point after the first, if you have less than three non-**incapacitated** friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE WARRIOR** operatives, you can set up another one ready and with a **Conceal** order wholly within your drop zone (you can select its weapon options as normal).

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - CANOPTEK TOMB CRAWLER
**Stats:**
- APL: 2
- Move: 5"
- Save: 3+
- Wounds: 21

**Weapons:**
| Type   | Name                          | ATK | HIT | DMG   | Weapon Rules                       |
|--------|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-------|------------------------------------|
| ranged | Transdimensional isolator     | 5   | 4+  | 5/6   | **Dimensional Banishment** |
| ranged | Twin gauss reapers (focused)  | 5   | 4+  | 4/5   | **Piercing 1**, **Severe** |
| ranged | Twin gauss reapers (sweeping) | 4   | 4+  | 4/5   | **Piercing 1**, **Severe**, **Torrent 1"** |

**Abilities:**
- **Dimensional Banishment:** After this operative uses this weapon, if you inflicted damage or retained any critical successes, if the target wasn't **incapacitated**, roll 2D6: if the result is higher than the target's remaining wounds, the target is **incapacitated**.
- **Weapon Sentinel:** Whenever your opponent is selecting a valid target, if this operative has a **Conceal** order, it cannot use **Light** terrain for cover. While this can allow this operative to be targeted (assuming it's visible), it doesn't remove its cover save (if any).
- **Steadfast:** Whenever determining control of a marker, you can treat this operative's APL stat as 3. If you do, this takes precedence over all other rules, meaning any changes to its APL stat are ignored for this.

# CANOPTEK CIRCLE STRATEGY PLOYS

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - HYPERSHIELDING
Whenever an operative is shooting a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative, if your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX** is intervening, or that friendly operative is within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, you can re-roll any of your defence dice results of one result (e.g. results of 2).

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - TRANSDYNAMIC AMPLIFICATION
Whenever a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative is shooting, if your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX** is intervening, or the target is within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, that friendly operative's weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - CRYPTOGRAVITIC REPULSION
Once per action, the first time an enemy operative would move within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, the distance is treated as an additional 1". Note this means if that enemy operative doesn't have sufficient move distance (e.g. it's at the end of its move), that operative cannot move within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - SOULDRAIN
Whenever an enemy operative is within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, or whenever it's fighting or retaliating against a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative that's within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, subtract 1 from both Dmg stats of that enemy operative's melee weapons (to a minimum of 2) until the end of the activation/**counteraction**. Note this means if the enemy operative moves through your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, apply this change at the end of that move action until the end of the activation/**counteraction**.

# CANOPTEK CIRCLE FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - SHIELD FLARE
Use this firefight ploy when an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative. If your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX** is intervening, or that friendly operative is within your **OBELISK NODE MATRIX**, ignore that inflicted damage. Note your opponent determines intervening (i.e. where on their operative's base to draw the targeting lines from).

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - ANIMATE OBELISK NODES
Use this firefight ploy when it's your turn to activate or **counteract**. Move any number of your **OBELISK NODE** markers instead. They can move up to 6" combined, and distances are always rounded up to the nearest inch (so if you move a marker 1.5", it's treated as moving it 2"). For example, you could move one marker 6", three markers 1" each, or any combination that doesn't exceed 6" in total. You can also move them 0" (to effectively skip an activation). In any case, your opponent activates as normal afterwards.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - NODAL RESPONSE
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative's activation, before or after it performs an action. You can either change one of the strategy ploys you used during this turning point (only pay additional CP if that ploy costs more), or use a strategy ploy now (pay its CP cost as normal).

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - SACRIFICIAL THRALL
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE GEOMANCER** operative is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one other friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE CANOPTEK** operative visible to and within 3" of that first friendly operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that other operative as being within the fighting operative's control range for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that other operative is only in cover or obscured if the original target was. This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

# CANOPTEK CIRCLE FACTION EQUIPMENT

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - MATRIX MANIPULATOR
Once per battle, during a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative's activation or **counteraction**, you can use this rule. If you do, until the end of that activation/**counteraction**, a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE GEOMANCER** operative is treated as your fourth **OBELISK NODE** marker.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - AWAKENED OBELISK NODES
After revealing this equipment option, roll one D3. You can use the **Animate Obelisk Nodes** firefight ploy for OCP a number of times during the battle equal to the result.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - NANOSCARAB CASKETS
Whenever a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE** operative is activated, it regains up to D3 lost wounds.

## CANOPTEK CIRCLE - PHASE SHIFTER
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **CANOPTEK CIRCLE GEOMANCER** operative, at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you can use this rule. If you do, worsen the x of the **Piercing** weapon rule by 1 (if any) until the end of that sequence. Note that **Piercing 1** would therefore be ignored.
