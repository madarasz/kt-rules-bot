## HAND OF THE ARCHON - Faction Rule - POWER FROM PAIN
The Drukhari feed on the souls of their slain and tortured victims, drawing sustenance from the terrible agonies they inflict.

After a friendly **HAND OF THE ARCHON** operative performs an action, it gains one of your Pain tokens if:
*   An enemy operative was injured during that action, but was not **incapacitated**.
*   An enemy operative was **incapacitated** during that action. If that enemy operative had a Wounds stat of 12 or more, that friendly operative gains two of your Pain tokens instead.

You can spend friendly operatives' Pain tokens on invigorations when the 'when' condition is met. You cannot use more than one invigoration per activation or counteraction, except Stimulated Senses, which can be used once per activation or counteraction in addition to another invigoration.

### HAND OF THE ARCHON - Faction Rule - POWER FROM PAIN - INVIGORATIONS
**Dark Animus**
**When:** During the operative's activation, before or after it performs an action.
**Effect:** Until the start of the operative's next activation, add 1 to its APL stat.

**Accelerated Rejuvenation**
**When:** During the operative's activation or counteraction, before or after it performs an action.
**Effect:** The operative regains D3+1 lost wounds.

**Vitalised Surge**
**When:** After the operative **incapacitates** an enemy operative and that enemy operative is removed from the killzone.
**Effect:** The operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action, even if it's performed an action that prevents it from performing the **Dash** action.

**Stimulated Senses**
**When:** After rolling your attack or defence dice for the operative.
**Effect:** You can re-roll one of your dice.

## HAND OF THE ARCHON - Faction Rule - RIFLES
Whenever a friendly **HAND OF THE ARCHON** operative is shooting with a splinter rifle during an activation in which it hasn't performed the **Charge**, **Fall Back** or **Reposition** action, that weapon has the **Accurate 1** weapon rule. Note that operative isn't restricted from performing those actions after shooting.
