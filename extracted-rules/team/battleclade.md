## BATTLECLADE - Operative Selection
Your kill team consists of 1 **BATTLECLADE TECHNOARCHEOLOGIST** operative, 1 **BATTLECLADE SERVITOR UNDERSEER** operative, and 8 **BATTLECLADE** operatives selected from the following list:
*   **AUTO-PROXY SERVITOR**
*   **BREACHER SERVITOR**
*   **COMBAT SERVITOR** with one of the following options:
    *   Servo-claw; incendine igniter
    *   Servo-claw; meltagun
    *   Servo-claw; phosphor blaster
*   **GUN SERVITOR** with heavy arc rifle and augmetic claw
*   **GUN SERVITOR** with heavy bolter and augmetic claw
*   **TECHNOMEDIC SERVITOR**

Other than **COMBAT SERVITOR** operatives, your kill team can only include each operative on this list once. Your kill team can only include up to one **COMBAT SERVITOR** operative with meltagun, and it can only include up to three **COMBAT SERVITOR** operatives with incendine igniter.

## BATTLECLADE - Archetypes
- INFILTRATION
- RECON

## BATTLECLADE - Faction Rule - NOOSPHERIC NETWORK
Whenever a friendly **BATTLECLADE SERVITOR** operative is activated, you can **TRANSFER POWER**. If you do, subtract 1 from its APL stat until the end of that activation.

After that activation, you can **NETWORK COUNTERACT** with one other friendly **BATTLECLADE SERVITOR** operative before your opponent activates. Whenever you **NETWORK COUNTERACT** with a friendly operative, first select its order. It can then perform a 1AP action for free, but cannot move. Once it's done so, your opponent then activates as normal.

An operative cannot **TRANSFER POWER** or **NETWORK COUNTERACT** if it has an APL stat of less than 2 (e.g. if the stat has been changed to less than 2 by a rule). **NETWORK COUNTERACT** is a counteraction, but the operative doesn't need to be expended with an Engage order to do it. That means if they're ready when they **NETWORK COUNTERACT**, they can still be activated as normal later in the turning point. An operative that does **NETWORK COUNTERACT** cannot do so again, or counteract, during the same turning point.

**1AP:** **SUPPORT**. Select one friendly **BATTLECLADE SERVITOR** operative within 6" of either this operative or a friendly **BATTLECLADE AUTO-PROXY** operative to immediately perform a free **Dash** action. You cannot select each friendly **SERVITOR** operative for this rule more than once per turning point. For the purposes of the Comms Device universal equipment, the operative the distance is being determined from must control that marker. This operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative.

### BATTLECLADE - Operatives - BATTLECLADE SERVITOR UNDERSEER - NETWORK OVERRIDE
**1AP:** **SUPPORT**. Select one friendly **BATTLECLADE SERVITOR** operative within 6" of either this operative or a friendly **BATTLECLADE AUTO-PROXY** operative to immediately **NETWORK COUNTERACT** (you don't have to **TRANSFER POWER** to do so). Continue this operative's activation after doing so. For the purposes of the Comms Device universal equipment, the operative the distance is being determined from must control that marker. This operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative.

### BATTLECLADE - Operatives - BATTLECLADE TECHNOMEDIC SERVITOR - Mechanosuture Array
Once per turning point, when another friendly **BATTLECLADE** operative would be **incapacitated** while **visible** to and within 3" of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within **control range** of an enemy operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn't **incapacitated**, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be **incapacitated** for the remainder of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within this operative's **control range**. If this rule was used during that friendly operative's activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is **incapacitated**, or if it's a **Shoot** action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.

### BATTLECLADE - Operatives - BATTLECLADE TECHNOMEDIC SERVITOR - EXPEDIENT REPAIR
**1AP:** Select one friendly **BATTLECLADE** operative within this operative's **control range** to regain up to D3+3 lost wounds. It cannot be an operative that the **Mechanosuture Array** rule was used on during this turning point. This operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative.

## BATTLECLADE - Strategy Ploy - NOOSPHERIC POSSESSION
**SUPPORT**. Whenever a friendly **BATTLECLADE SERVITOR** operative is within 6" of a friendly **BATTLECLADE AUTO-PROXY** or **BATTLECLADE SERVITOR UNDERSEER** operative, that friendly **SERVITOR** operative's weapons have the **Accurate 1** weapon rule. For the purposes of the Comms Device universal equipment, the operative the distance is being determined from must control that marker.

## BATTLECLADE - Strategy Ploy - DUTY OF RECLAMATION
Once per action, you can use the Command Re-roll firefight ploy for 0CP if the attack or defence dice was rolled for a friendly **BATTLECLADE** operative that contests an objective marker or one of your mission markers.

## BATTLECLADE - Strategy Ploy - INCANTATION OF THE IRON SOUL
Whenever an attack dice inflicts damage of 3 or more on a friendly **BATTLECLADE** operative, roll one D6: on a 5+, subtract 1 from that inflicted damage.

## BATTLECLADE - Strategy Ploy - PRIORITISED ACQUISITION
Select one objective marker or one of your mission markers.
*   Whenever determining control of that marker, treat the total APL stat of friendly **BATTLECLADE** operatives that contest it as 1 higher if at least one friendly **BATTLECLADE** operative contests that marker. Note this isn't a change to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative with this.
*   Whenever a friendly **BATTLECLADE** operative is within 3" of that marker, add 1 to the Atk stat of its melee weapons (to a maximum of 4).

## BATTLECLADE - Firefight Ploy - SYSTEM EXORCISM
Use this firefight ploy when you would activate a friendly **BATTLECLADE** operative. Remove one rules effect or stat change your opponent has applied to it (e.g. Poison token, -1APL, cannot be activated or perform actions, etc), then activate it. This ploy cannot allow it to regain lost wounds, ignore the effects of being injured, remove mission pack rules or remove -1APL that you've applied to it (i.e. from **TRANSFER POWER**).

## BATTLECLADE - Firefight Ploy - REMOTE ACCESS
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **BATTLECLADE TECH-PRIEST** operative's activation. Once during that activation, you can use one of the following rules:
*   That operative doesn't require a marker to be within its **control range** to perform a mission action that usually requires this (this takes precedence over that action's conditions). Instead, the marker must be within 4" of it and no enemy operatives can contest that marker. However, you can ignore enemy operatives within **control range** of other friendly **BATTLECLADE** operatives when determining this.
*   That operative doesn't require a hatchway's access point to be within its **control range** to perform an **Operate Hatch** action. Instead, that access point must be within 4" of it.

## BATTLECLADE - Firefight Ploy - AUTO-FERRIC SUPPLICATION
Use this firefight ploy when an operative is shooting a friendly **BATTLECLADE TECH-PRIEST** operative, at the start of the Roll Attack Dice step. Until the end of the sequence, ignore the **Piercing** weapon rule.

## BATTLECLADE - Firefight Ploy - SERVILE SURROGACY
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **BATTLECLADE TECH-PRIEST** operative is selected as the valid target of a **Shoot** action or to fight against during the **Fight** action. Select one friendly **BATTLECLADE SERVITOR** operative **visible** to and within 3" of that first friendly operative to become the valid target or to be fought against (as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn't normally be valid for this). If it's the **Fight** action, treat that **SERVITOR** operative as being within the fighting operative's **control range** for the duration of that action. If it's the **Shoot** action, that **SERVITOR** operative is only **in cover** or **obscured** if the original target was.

This ploy has no effect if it's the **Shoot** action and the ranged weapon has the **Blast** or **Torrent** weapon rule.

## BATTLECLADE - Faction Equipment - COVERT GUISES
After revealing this equipment option, roll one D3. As a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in the first turning point, a number of friendly **BATTLECLADE** operatives equal to the result that are **wholly within** your drop zone can immediately perform a free **Reposition** action, but must end that move **wholly within** 3" of your drop zone. Your **TECHNOARCHEOLOGIST** operative cannot perform more than one **Reposition** action in the Strategy phase of the first turning point (i.e. as a result of the **Seeker of Divine Arcana** rule as well).

## BATTLECLADE - Faction Equipment - ELECTROMANTIC CAPACITORS
Friendly **BATTLECLADE** operatives' melee weapons have the **Shock** weapon rule. Whenever a ready friendly **BATTLECLADE** operative is retaliating, its melee weapons also have the **Severe** weapon rule.

## BATTLECLADE - Faction Equipment - CONCEALED APPARATUS
**STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in the second turning point. You can swap the locations of any number of friendly **BATTLECLADE SERVITOR** operatives with each other (excluding **GUN SERVITOR**), and you can swap the locations of friendly **BATTLECLADE GUN SERVITOR** operatives with each other (remove them from the killzone and set them back up again). You cannot swap any operatives that have done any of the following during the battle:
*   Used any weapons on their datacard.
*   Performed any actions on their datacard.
*   Used the **Mechanosuture Array** rule (see **TECHNOMEDIC**).

## BATTLECLADE - Faction Equipment - NEUROCYCLIC RESERVE CELLS
After revealing this equipment option, roll one D3. A number of times during the battle equal to the result, whenever you **TRANSFER POWER**, you can use this rule. If you do, don't subtract 1 from the operative's APL stat, but it cannot perform **Shoot** or **Fight** actions during that activation (this takes precedence over the normal Noospheric Network rules).

[FAQ]
*Question*: If my opponent uses a rule that would cancel or interrupt when I would activate an operative (e.g. **NEMESIS CLAW** Vox Scream, **MANDRAKE DIRGEMAW** Haunting Focus), can I use the **System Exorcism** firefight ploy to stop my opponent's rule from taking effect?
