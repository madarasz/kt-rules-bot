## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - Faction Rule - FRENZY
**Fellgor Ravagers** channel their pain into an animalistic frenzy, dismissing wounds and bursting with aggression.

Whenever a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative that doesn't have one of your Frenzy tokens would be **incapacitated** during the battle, it's not **incapacitated** and it gains one of your Frenzy tokens. All remaining attack dice are discarded (including yours if this operative is fighting or retaliating). If it has a **Conceal** order, change it to **Engage**.

Whenever a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative has one of your Frenzy tokens:
- It's only **incapacitated** as detailed below.
- It cannot have a **Conceal** order.
- It's injured.
- It cannot perform the **Pick Up Marker** or mission actions (excluding **Operate Hatch**).
- For the purpose of determining **control** of markers, treat its APL stat as 1. This takes precedence over any stat changes.

A friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative that has one of your Frenzy tokens is **incapacitated** when one of the following is met:
- Its activation or counteraction ends.
- An enemy operative is fighting against or retaliating against it and your opponent strikes with a critical success.
- An enemy operative is fighting against or retaliating against it and your opponent strikes it for a second time with a normal success. Note this can be strikes from two different **Fight** actions.
- An enemy operative is shooting it and Critical Dmg is inflicted on it.
- The battle ends (resolve this before any victory conditions that resolve at the end of the battle).

Your opponent treats a **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative as being **incapacitated** (instead of when it would be **incapacitated** normally) when it gains one of your Frenzy tokens for the purposes of scoring VPs (e.g. kill op) and faction rules that require it to be **incapacitated** (e.g. **HAND OF THE ARCHON** Power From Pain, **CHAOS CULT** Mutation, etc.).

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - Firefight Ploy - RUTHLESS RAMPAGE
Use this firefight ploy after a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative performs the **Fight** action, if it's no longer **wholly within control range** of enemy operatives.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - Firefight Ploy - WILD RAGE
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative is activated. Until the end of that operative's activation, add 1" to its Move stat.

When that first friendly operative is expended, you can activate that other friendly operative before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal.

Once per battle, you can use the **Animalistic Fury** and **Wild Rage** firefight ploys for 0CP each.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - Faction Equipment - GORE MARKS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative is fighting or retaliating, you can use this rule. If you do, inflict 1 damage on that friendly operative and re-roll one of your attack dice. If the result is a fail, inflict 1 additional damage on that friendly operative.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - Faction Equipment - CHAOS SIGIL
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative, at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you can use this rule.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - Faction Equipment - WAR PAINT
You can ignore any changes to the Move stat of friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operatives from being injured.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - Rules Commentaries
[FAQ]
*Question*: If one of my dice is re-rolled or replaced by an opponent’s rule (e.g. **HAND OF THE ARCHON** Omen, **WARPCOVEN** Fate Itself Is My Weapon), can I still use the **Violent Temperament** strategy ploy to re-roll my attack dice?
*Answer*: **Yes, but only the dice that were not re-rolled or replaced.**
