# FELLGOR RAVAGERS FACTION RULES

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - FRENZY
Whenever a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative that doesn't have one of your Frenzy tokens would be incapacitated during the battle, it's not incapacitated and it gains one of your Frenzy tokens. All remaining attack dice are discarded (including yours if this operative is fighting or retaliating). If it has a Conceal order, change it to Engage.

Whenever a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative has one of your Frenzy tokens:
- It's only incapacitated as detailed below.
- It cannot have a Conceal order.
- It's injured.
- It cannot perform the **Pick Up Marker** or mission actions (excluding **Operate Hatch**).
- For the purpose of determining control of markers, treat its APL stat as 1. This takes precedence over any stat changes.

A friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative that has one of your Frenzy tokens is incapacitated when one of the following is met:
- Its activation or counteraction ends.
- An enemy operative is fighting against or retaliating against it and your opponent strikes with a critical success.
- An enemy operative is fighting against or retaliating against it and your opponent strikes it for a second time with a normal success. Note this can be strikes from two different **Fight** actions.
- An enemy operative is shooting it and Critical Dmg is inflicted on it.
- The battle ends (resolve this before any victory conditions that resolve at the end of the battle).

Your opponent treats a **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative as being incapacitated (instead of when it would be incapacitated normally) when it gains one of your Frenzy tokens for the purposes of scoring VPs (e.g. kill op) and faction rules that require it to be incapacitated (e.g. **HAND OF THE ARCHON** Power From Pain, **CHAOS CULT** Mutation, etc.).

# FELLGOR RAVAGERS STRATEGY PLOYS

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - VIOLENT TEMPERAMENT
Whenever a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative is fighting or retaliating, after rolling your attack dice, you can use this rule. If you do, you must re-roll all of your attack dice (you cannot only re-roll some).

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - AMBUSH
Whenever a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative is activated, if its order is changed from Conceal to Engage, it's ambushing for that activation. Whenever a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative that's ambushing is fighting, you can retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it, or you can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead. Note that an operative that has one of your Frenzy tokens cannot ambush.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - PELTING FIREPOWER
Whenever a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative is shooting an enemy operative that's been shot by another friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative during this turning point, that first friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Ceaseless** weapon rule; if the enemy operative has been shot by more than one other friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative during this turning point, that first friendly operative's ranged weapons have the **Relentless** weapon rule instead.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - RECKLESS DETERMINATION
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting an expended friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative, if you cannot retain any cover saves, you can retain one of your defence dice as a normal success without rolling it (in addition to a cover save, if any).

# FELLGOR RAVAGERS FIREFIGHT PLOYS

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - RUTHLESS RAMPAGE
Use this firefight ploy after a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative performs the **Fight** action, if it's no longer within control range of enemy operatives. That friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Charge** action (even if it's already performed the **Charge** action during that activation), but cannot move more than 3" during that action.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - WILD RAGE
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative is activated. Until the end of that operative's activation, add 1" to its Move stat.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - ANIMALISTIC FURY
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative is fighting or retaliating and you strike with a critical success. Inflict 1 additional damage with that strike.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - BLOODSENSE
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative's activation, when it incapacitates an enemy operative within its control range. Select one other ready friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative that's visible to and within 3" of the incapacitated enemy operative. When that first friendly operative is expended, you can activate that other friendly operative before your opponent activates. When that other operative is expended, your opponent then activates as normal.

# FELLGOR RAVAGERS FACTION EQUIPMENT

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - BRASS ADORNMENTS
Once per battle, you can use the **Animalistic Fury** and **Wild Rage** firefight ploys for 0CP each.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - GORE MARKS
Once per turning point, when a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative is fighting or retaliating, you can use this rule. If you do, inflict 1 damage on that friendly operative and re-roll one of your attack dice. If the result is a fail, inflict 1 additional damage on that friendly operative.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - CHAOS SIGIL
Once per turning point, when an operative is shooting a friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operative, at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you can use this rule. If you do, worsen the x of the **Piercing** weapon rule by 1 (if any) until the end of that sequence. Note that **Piercing 1** would therefore be ignored.

## FELLGOR RAVAGERS - WAR PAINT
You can ignore any changes to the Move stat of friendly **FELLGOR RAVAGER** operatives from being injured.

# FELLGOR RAVAGERS RULES COMMENTARIES
[FAQ]
*Question*: If one of my dice is re-rolled or replaced by an opponent's rule (e.g. **HAND OF THE ARCHON** **Omen**, **WARPCOVEN** **Fate Itself Is My Weapon**), can I still use the **Violent Temperament** strategy ploy to re-roll my attack dice?
*Answer*: Yes, but only the dice that were not re-rolled or replaced.
