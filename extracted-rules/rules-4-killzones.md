### **Killzones**
Killzones provide an immersive experience and a tactically engaging battlefield for your operatives. There are specific killzones available - simply use the game board and terrain features a killzone includes. You can also create your own killzone from the game boards and terrain features in your collection. Unless otherwise specified, a killzone game board is **30" x 22"**.

> **Designer's Note:** If you are new to Kill Team, select one killzone to start with. Then, as you become more experienced, you'll soon relish the diverse gameplay that different killzones provide.

### **Terrain and Movement**
Operatives cannot move through terrain - they must move around, climb over or drop/jump off it. Operatives must finish a move in a location they can be placed they cannot finish midway through a climb, drop or jump. If this isn't possible, they cannot begin the move.

[Derived from illustration]
**Movement Measurement:** Movement is measured in three dimensions. Vertical movement (climbing or dropping) and horizontal movement are measured separately and combined to determine the total distance an operative moves. An operative moving up a **4"** wall, across a **2"** platform, and dropping down would calculate each segment of that movement.

> **Designer's Note:** Remember that increments are rounded up, so if the operative moves **3.5"** this is treated as **4"**.

#### **Climbing**
An operative must be **within 1"** horizontally and **3"** vertically of terrain that's visible to them to climb it. Each climb is treated as a minimum of **2"** vertically (e.g. a **1"** distance is treated as **2"**).

[Derived from illustration]
**Climbing over Obstacles:** To climb over an object, an operative moves up until it's above the highest point it must cross, moves horizontally until its base is clear of the feature, and then drops down on the other side. A **1"** high obstacle would cost a minimum of **2"** to move up, the horizontal distance to clear it, and **0"** to drop down (as the drop is less than **2"**).

#### **Dropping**
Operatives drop down when they move off terrain or after they've jumped. Ignore **2"** of vertical distance that they drop during each action. This means a vertical drop of **2"** or less is ignored. If they drop multiple times during an action, only **2"** total is ignored, not **2"** from each drop.

[Derived from illustration]
**Calculating Drop Distance:** The first **2"** of any vertical drop is ignored. For a total vertical drop of **4"**, the operative would count as having moved **2"** vertically (4" - 2" = 2"). A drop of **2"** or less costs **0"** of movement.

#### **Jumping**
Operatives can jump from **Vantage** terrain higher than **2"** from the killzone floor when they move off it. You can move them up to **4"** horizontally from the edge when they jump, done like any other move except in one straight-line increment. The operative must then drop or climb from there. When jumping *from* a terrain feature, if there is a rampart at the edge you would jump from, you must climb it first before doing so, but still jump from the level of the **Vantage** terrain. When jumping to a terrain feature, you can ignore its height difference of **1"** or less, including its rampart (if any).

[Summary]
Jumping allows operatives to cross horizontal gaps up to **4"** wide. From a **Vantage** higher than "2, they can also jump over objects lower than them, up to **4"** away. After the horizontal jump movement, the operative must resolve any vertical movement by dropping or climbing.

### **Terrain Types**
A terrain feature is composed of different parts, each of which is a type of terrain (one part can be more than one type). If you are using a terrain feature from a specific killzone, the type of each part of that terrain feature will be specified. If you are using a terrain feature from a killzone of your own creation, you must specify the type of each part of that terrain feature before the battle. The most common types of terrain are below, but some killzones have their own types.

> **Designer's Note:** Always view terrain features in parts, rather than as one large terrain feature where everything is the same. For example, if a rule says ignore **Light** terrain, only ignore the parts of a terrain feature that are the **Light** type, not the whole terrain feature. It's good to have a mixture of **Light** and **Heavy** terrain in your killzone, as some other rules interact with each type differently.

#### **Heavy**
Larger terrain is **Heavy**. It can obscure operatives.

#### **Light**
Smaller terrain is **Light**. It doesn't have any additional rules, but other rules interact with it differently.

> **Designer's Note:** If you wish, objective markers can also have **Light** terrain using these miniatures. The **40mm** base is still the marker, but the terrain attached to it is **Light**.

#### **Blocking**
**Blocking** terrain is usually attributed to gaps between or underneath a terrain feature. Visibility cannot be drawn through such gaps, and for the purposes of cover and obscured, the gaps are intervening like the terrain around it.

[Derived from illustration]
**Blocking Terrain Examples:**
* The gap underneath a large pipe.
* The viewpoint through a closed, solid door.
* A broken vent cover that is visually blocked.

> **Designer's Note:** Technically, **Blocking** terrain isn't actually physical terrain, but rather the gaps operatives shouldn't be able to see through. **Blocking** terrain is rare, but it exists for the necessary instances.

#### **Vantage**
**Vantage** terrain is the upper levels of the killzone areas operatives can be placed upon above the game board. If terrain is not **Vantage** terrain, then operatives can move over it, but they cannot finish a move or be set up on it. **Vantage** terrain is also **Light** terrain. **Vantage** terrain has the following main features.
* **Firstly**, whenever an operative on **Vantage** terrain is shooting an operative that has an **Engage** order, its ranged weapon has the **Accurate 1** weapon rule if the target operative is at least **2"** lower than it, or **Accurate 2** if the target operative is at least **4"** lower than it.
* **Secondly**, whenever you are selecting a valid target for an operative on **Vantage** terrain, operatives at least **2"** lower than that operative with a **Conceal** order cannot use **Light** terrain for cover. Whilst this can allow such operatives to be targeted (assuming they're visible), it doesn't remove their cover save, and the defender can retain it as a critical success instead, or retain one additional cover save.
* **Thirdly**, for the purposes of obscured, ignore **Heavy** terrain connected to **Vantage** terrain the active operative or the intended target is on.

If an operative is obstructed from moving across **Vantage** terrain by enemy operatives or other terrain features, it can move around these obstructions (without dropping off) so long as part of its base is always on the **Vantage** terrain.

[Derived from illustration]
**Vantage Point Targeting Principle:** An operative (A) on a **Vantage** point that is at least **2"** higher than a target operative (B) with a **Conceal** order can target that operative even if B is in cover from **Light** terrain. Operative B is still a valid target but receives an improved cover save.

> **Designer's Note:** As **Vantage** terrain is also **Light**, an operative on **Vantage** terrain will often be in cover from operatives lower than them-imagine them crouching down to gain a cover save or avoid being a valid target. An operative on **Vantage** terrain can target an operative with a **Conceal** order that's **2"** lower than them and only in cover from **Light** terrain.

#### **Accessible**
Operatives can move through **Accessible** terrain, but it counts as an additional **1"** to do so. Only the centre of an operative's base needs to move through **Accessible** terrain, so base sizes are irrelevant.

[Derived from illustration]
An example of **Accessible** terrain is a doorway.

#### **Insignificant**
**Insignificant** terrain is usually very small. For the purposes of climbing and dropping, ignore it. An operative can move over and across **Insignificant** terrain without going up and down.

[Derived from illustration]
**Insignificant Terrain Examples:**
* Small extraneous parts like storm bolters on a container.
* Small piles of rubble.

> **Designer's Note:** It's particularly important to identify **Insignificant** and **Exposed** terrain before the battle, to prevent misunderstandings later on.

#### **Exposed**
**Exposed** terrain is usually very small, or terrain with large gaps that operatives shouldn't be able to take cover behind. For the purposes of cover and obscured, it's never intervening.

[Derived from illustration]
**Exposed Terrain Examples:**
* A ladder.
* Hanging chains.

#### **Ceiling**
Operatives can move underneath Ceiling terrain regardless of the operative’s height (this takes precedence over `Terrain and Movement`). The operative must still finish the action in a location it can be placed.’
