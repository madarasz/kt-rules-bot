## Recommended Terrain Layouts
Approved Ops 2025 contains 6 terrain layouts for each killzone currently in the Kill Team product range, alongside maps for Killzone: Gallowdark and non-specific killzone maps. These are all recommended for tournament play, but they are not the only terrain layouts that can be used for a balanced experience. The maps in Approved Ops 2025 may not directly correlate to an exact measurement of terrain, so it's at your discretion as an organiser to make decisions about these placements. To encourage adaptability and generalship at the table, tournament organisers may make their own maps using their own collections of Kill Team terrain using the example killzones from Approved Ops 2025 as a guideline. We recommend tables be preset for the day with an even variety of terrain layouts, and that players be rotated through the layouts with each pairing. Note that depending on the number of layouts and rounds, this means some players may repeat a layout over the course of the event.

## Crit Op Selection
We recommend that all players be playing the same crit op in the same round to create the most consistent results for **win paths** (explained below) in the pairings metrics. To do this, tournament organisers should select crit ops for players in each round of the tournament, either randomly or predetermined. While organisers can select any crit ops randomly using the cards from Approved Ops 2025, we also find that some groups of crit ops feature similar play patterns. For a wider variety of mission types in each tournament, organisers can select one from each of these groupings for each round:
* **Group 1:** Secure, Loot, Transmission
* **Group 2:** Orb, Energy Cells, Download
* **Group 3:** Stake Claim, Data, Reboot

## Pairings
We recommend that players be randomly paired into their matches for the first round. When selecting pairings for players in the following rounds, the most important aspect of pairings would be to ensure that players with a similar number of wins and losses are playing against one another (e.g. a player with 3 wins, 1 loss and 0 draws should play against another player with those same results if possible). However, it is inevitable to have many players with the same win/loss record. In those cases, we recommend pairing players with the following criteria:
* Firstly, by record (i.e. wins, losses, draws).
* Secondly, by **win path** (i.e. the timing of the rounds in which a player won or lost their games).
* Thirdly, randomly within players of the same ranking.

### Tie in Record for Pairings
If you have an odd number of players with an identical record, you can pair the player that is currently lowest ranked within players of a record with the highest ranked in the next record down, then determine the rest of the pairings, repeating this process as necessary.

### Win Path
A player's **win path** refers not to their number of wins and losses, but to the timing of those wins and losses. While pairing by **win path** has an incidental tendency to pair people by **'strength of schedule'** (see below), its greatest impact is on the overall enjoyment experienced by all players, as it tends to pair players based upon shared experience. **Win path** ensures players enter their match with recent common experiences upon which to build a friendship during their next game of **Warhammer**.

### Draws
Draws are a perfectly valid result of a game of **Kill Team**. We highly discourage the use of tiebreakers to decide the results of an individual game, and organisers should instead use the **Rankings** criteria below to resolve ties when determining the results of the event. We also recommend that a draw not be excessively punishing on a win record, as the relatively low score potential within **Kill Team** results in a higher frequency of draws. In general, we recommend that the result of two draws be an equal record result to a win and a loss.

> **Designer's Note:** Organisers can use apps like Best Coast Pairings, which includes preset metrics for **pairings** and **rankings** to help resolve issues and accurately record secondary stats like **strength of schedule**.

## Rankings
At the end of the tournament, it is quite common for a number of players to have an identical record. To determine ranking players within your results, we recommend the following criteria:
* Firstly, by overall record (i.e. wins, losses, draws).
* Secondly, by their opponent's win records (i.e. those with more wins against opponents with better win records would place higher).
* Thirdly, by total **VP** scored in all games from the primary op (i.e. a player who scores an additional **3VP** from their primary op selection would receive **3 points** when determining this ranking criteria).

### Strength of Schedule
Our second criteria for rankings - **opponent's win records** - is also referred to as **strength of schedule**. In a difficult match between equally skilled players, we expect a player's score to be lower on average than a match against a less skilled opponent. Therefore, **strength of schedule** can be used to determine the difficulty of matches a player made it through to achieve their final result. We don't recommend using overall **VP** as a criteria in pairings or rankings, as these results can be lowered even when winning a match if your opponent or matchup was difficult.

## Rulings
The high number of games in a **Warhammer** event means that players are likely to discover unusual rules interactions and edge cases. When encountering these interactions, try to be as fair as possible to players and make the best judgement you are able. To support this, the **Warhammer Design Studio** release regular **Rules Updates** on **Kill Team: The App** to create the most up-to-date and precise wordings possible. Whenever a printed rule contradicts an online rule, the online rule will take precedence. If you are unsure of an interaction, check these living documents first to ensure you have the best chance of successfully resolving the issue. Once you have made a ruling during an event, we recommend continuing to resolve the interaction that way for the remainder of the event.

## Classified Format
When planning your tournament, you must determine if it will be using the **Classified format**. We recommend making your tournament **Classified** if your prizes for winning include a ticket to the **World Championships of Warhammer**. In all other tournament settings, you may allow play of all kill teams with **3rd edition rules**. **Classified** teams can be played in **Classified format** tournaments. Teams that are not **Classified** will continue to receive regular **Rules Updates** balance updates, designer's commentaries and erratas - and will be balanced throughout the current edition of **Kill Team**.

## Classified Rotation
The full list of **Classified** kill teams can be found below. Currently, all kill teams with **3rd edition rules** are **Classified**. Teams will be added to this list as they are released, and teams from the **Octarius season** will no longer be **Classified** following the **World Championships of Warhammer in November 2025**.
