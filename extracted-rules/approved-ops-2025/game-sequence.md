# Approved Ops & Game Sequence

## APPROVED OPS (2025)

### HOW TO USE THESE CARDS
This is the second PvP mission pack for Kill Team (2024).

Each player must score VP during the game from three different ops:

### CRIT OP
Score VP by performing mission actions and controlling objective markers.

### KILL OP
Score VP as enemy operatives are incapacitated.

### TAC OP - described in `tacops.md`
Score VP from a tac op selected in secret from one of their kill team's archetypes. Each tac op specifies when it should be revealed.

### PRIMARY OP
As a **Strategic Gambit** in the first turning point, each player secretly selects one of the above ops to be their primary op. At the end of the battle they reveal these operative cards once additional VP from that op. When the battle ends, the player with the most VP is the winner.

## GAME SEQUENCE

### 1. SET UP THE BATTLE
* Each player selects a kill team for the battle.
* Determine the killzone and set up terrain features. Ensure terrain types are specified.
* Determine one shared crit op and set up objective markers. Other than in Killzone: Bheta-Decima, all objective markers must be set up on the killzone floor.
* Roll-off - the winner decides who has initiative.
* The player with initiative selects one drop zone. Their opponent has the other drop zone and gains the Re-roll initiative card.

### 2. SELECT OPERATIVES
* Each player secretly selects their operatives for the battle, adhering to the selection requirements in their kill team rules. They then reveal their selections simultaneously.
* Each player secretly selects up to four equipment options. Each option cannot be selected more than once per player. They then reveal their selections simultaneously.
* Each player starts with 2CP.
* Each player secretly selects a tac op from one of their kill team's archetypes (Infiltration, Recon, Security, or Seek & Destroy), as specified in their kill team's rules.

### 3. SET UP OPERATIVES
* Each player alternates setting up an item of equipment that's set up before the battle (ladders, etc.), starting with the player with initiative. Note it's item, not option by option.
* Each player alternates setting up one third of their kill team (rounding up), starting with the player with initiative. When a player sets up an operative, it must be wholly within their drop zone and must be given a Conceal order.

### 4. PLAY THE BATTLE
* To determine initiative during each turning point (including the first), the players roll off (but don't re-roll ties). Starting with the loser of the roll-off, each player alternates either using an initiative card to alter their roll result or passing, until they both pass in succession.
* Turning/1 would use thie kill team's rules to affect the roll-off; they must do so before playing initiative cards, starting with the player that's losing the roll off.
* The Re-roll initiative card allows the player to re-roll their initiative roll. The remaining initiative cards modify the player's roll result up to down (i.e. +1 takes it above 6 or below 1). For example, if a player rolls a 3 and plays the +2/-2 initiative card, they can modify their roll result to be 2. If a player uses the Re-roll initiative card after they've modified their roll result, the new result superseded their modification(s) used so far.

### 4. Continued
* The winner of the roll-off decides who has initiative. Excluding the fourth turning point, the loser of the roll-off gains an initiative card equal to the turning point number (e.g. in the second turning point they would gain the +2/-2 initiative card). If the roll-off is a tie, the player who doesn't currently have initiative is the winner. Note that it's the loser of the roll-off that gains the initiative card, not the player without initiative.
* As a STRATEGIC GAMBIT in the first turning point, each player secretly selects one of their three ops (1, crit, 2, kill, or 3, tac) to be their primary op. They should place a card with their selection face down, covered a die showing their selection down - crit = 3, kill = initiative = 1.
* Each player can score a maximum of 6VP from each op.

### 5. END THE BATTLE
* The battle ends after four turning points have been completed. If one player has no operatives in the killzone but the battle hasn't ended, the other player plays out each remaining turning point until it does.
* At the end of the battle, the players reveal their primary ops simultaneously. They score additional VP equal to half of what they scored from that op (rounding up).
* The player with the most VP is the winner. If the players are tied, it's a draw.

## Initiative Cards

### +3/-3 TO YOUR INITIATIVE ROLL
Give this to the player that lost the initiative roll during the third turning point. They can use it once in a subsequent Strategy phase.

### +2/-2 TO YOUR INITIATIVE ROLL
Give this to the player that lost the initiative roll during the second turning point. They can use it once in a subsequent Strategy phase.

### +1/-1 TO YOUR INITIATIVE ROLL
Give this to the player that lost the initiative roll during the first turning point. They can use it once in a subsequent Strategy phase.

### RE-ROLL YOUR INITIATIVE ROLL
Give this to the player that didn't have initiative when setting up the battle (i.e. didn't select drop zones). They can use it once in a subsequent Strategy phase.

[Summary]
**Initiative System Overview:**
The initiative system uses a roll-off at the start of each turning point, with the loser gaining progressive bonuses through initiative cards. These cards can modify rolls or allow re-rolls, creating a catch-up mechanic that balances gameplay across turns.

[Summary]
**Victory Point Structure:**
Players score VP through three separate operations (Crit, Kill, and Tac), with a maximum of **6VP** from each. The primary op selection adds strategic depth by providing bonus VP equal to half the scored amount from that op at game end.

[Derived from illustration]
**Initiative Card Distribution:**
Initiative cards are distributed based on turning point timing, with higher modifiers (+3/-3) given in later turns to create stronger comeback potential for the player losing initiative rolls.
