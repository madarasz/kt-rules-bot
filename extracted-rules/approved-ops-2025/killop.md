## Approved Ops 2025 - Kill Op Rules

**HOW TO SCORE**
* You start without a **Kill Grade**. As enemy operatives are incapacitated, your **kill grade** goes up until it reaches **5**.
* Whenever you move to a new **kill grade**, you score **1VP**.
* At the end of the fourth turning point, if your **kill grade** is higher than your opponent's, you score **1VP**.
* On a tie, neither player scores an extra VP.
* The table below shows how many enemy operatives must be incapacitated to reach each **kill grade**.
* The row you use is determined by the starting number of enemy operatives.
