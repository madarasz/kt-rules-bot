# Tac OP - Recon

## Flank

**Reveal**  
As a **Strategic Gambit**.

**Additional Rules**  
Divide the killzone into two flanks (left and right) by drawing an imaginary line that's just like the centreline, except it runs from the centre of each player's killzone edge. An operative contests a flank while both wholly within it and within their opponent's territory. Friendly operatives control a flank if the total APL stat of those contesting it is greater than that of enemy operatives.

**Victory Points**  
After measuring this on the end of each turning point after the first, for each flank friendly operatives control, you score 1VP. If friendly operatives also controlled that flank at the end of the previous turning point (excluding the first), you score 2VP instead.

You cannot score more than 2VP from this op per turning point.

## Scout Enemy Movement

**Reveal**  
The first time a friendly operative performs the **Scout** action.

**Mission Action**  
**Scout** **1AP**
* Select one ready enemy operative visible to and more than 6" from the active operative. That enemy operative is now monitored until the Ready step of the next Strategy phase.
* An operative cannot perform this action while it has an Engage order, during the first turning point, or while within control range of an enemy operative.

**Victory Points**  
At the end of each turning point after the first, for each monitored enemy operative that's visible to friendly operatives, you score 1VP. Note that it doesn't have to be a friendly operative that performed the Scout action.

You cannot score more than 2VP from this op per turning point.

## Retrieval

**Reveal**  
The first time you score VP from this op.

**Mission Action**  
**Retrieve** **1AP**
* If the active operative controls an objective marker that hasn't been searched by friendly operatives, that operative is now carrying one of your **Retrieval** mission markers and that objective marker has been searched by friendly operatives. Friendly operatives can perform the **Pick Up Marker** action on your Retrieval mission markers.
* An operative cannot perform this action during the first turning point, or while within control range of an enemy operative.

**Victory Points**  
The first time each objective marker is searched by friendly operatives, you score 1VP.

At the end of the battle, for each of your Retrieval mission markers friendly operatives are carrying, you score 1VP.

## Track Enemy

**Reveal**

An enemy operative is being tracked if it's a **valid target** for a friendly operative **within 6"** of it. That friendly operative must have a **Conceal** order, cannot be a **valid target** for the enemy operative it's attempting to track, and cannot be within control range of enemy operatives.

**Victory Points**  
At the end of each turning point after the first:
* If one enemy operative is being tracked, you score 1VP; or 2VP instead if it's the fourth turning point.

Friendly operatives can perform the **Pick Up Marker** action on your Intelligence mission markers, and for the purpose of that action's conditions, ignore the first Intelligence mission marker the active operative is carrying. In other words, each friendly operative can carry up to two Intelligence mission markers, or one and one other marker.

**Victory Points**  
At the end of each turning point after the first, if any friendly operatives are carrying any of your Intelligence mission markers, you score 1VP.

At the end of the battle, for each of your Intelligence mission markers friendly operatives are carrying, you score 1VP.

## Plant Devices

**Reveal**  
The first time a friendly operative performs the **Plant Device** action.

**Mission Action**  
**Plant Device** **1AP**
* One objective marker the active operative controls gains one of your Device tokens.
* An operative cannot perform this action during the first turning point, while within control range of an enemy operative, or if that objective marker already has one of your Device tokens.

**Victory Points**  
At the end of each turning point after the first:
* If your opponent's objective marker has one of your Device tokens, you score 1VP.
* For each other objective marker enemy operatives control that has one of your Device tokens, you score 1VP.

* An operative cannot perform this action during the first turning point, while within control range of an enemy operative, or if a friendly operative has already performed this action during the battle.

**Victory Points**  
At the end of each turning point after the first, if your Banner mission marker is wholly within your opponent's territory and friendly operatives control it, you score 1VP; if that's true and no enemy operatives control it, you score 2VP instead.
