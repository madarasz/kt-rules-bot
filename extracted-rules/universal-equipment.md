## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - 1X AMMO CACHE
Before the battle, you can set up one of your **Ammo Cache** markers **wholly within your territory**.

Friendly operatives can perform the following mission action during the battle.

- **AMMO RESUPPLY 1AP:** One of your **Ammo Cache** markers the active operative **controls** is used during this turning point. Until the start of the next turning point, whenever this operative is **shooting** with a weapon from its datacard, you can re-roll one of your attack dice. An operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative, if that marker isn't yours, or if that marker has been used this turning point.

## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - 1X RAZOR WIRE
**Razor wire** is **Exposed** and **Obstructing** terrain. Before the battle, you can set it up **wholly within your territory**, on the killzone floor and more than $2^{\prime\prime}$ from other equipment terrain features, access points and **Accessible** terrain.

- **Obstructing:** Whenever an operative would cross over this terrain feature within $1^{\prime\prime}$ of it, treat the distance as an additional $1^{\prime\prime}$.

## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - 1X COMMS DEVICE
Before the battle, you can set up one of your **Comms Device** markers **wholly within your territory**.

While a friendly operative **controls** this marker, add $3^{\prime\prime}$ to the distance requirements of its **SUPPORT** rules that refer to friendly operatives (e.g. 'select one friendly operative within $6^{\prime\prime}$' would be $9^{\prime\prime}$ instead). Note that you cannot benefit from your opponent's **Comms Device** markers.

## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - 1X MINES
Before the battle, you can set up one of your **Mines** markers **wholly within your territory** and more than $2^{\prime\prime}$ from other markers, access points and **Accessible** terrain. The first time that marker is within an operative's **control range**, remove that marker and inflict **D3+3** damage on that operative.

## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - 2X LIGHT BARRICADES
**Light barricades** are **Light** terrain, except the feet, which are **Insignificant** and **Exposed**. Before the battle, you can set up any of them **wholly within your territory**, on the killzone floor and more than $2^{\prime\prime}$ from other equipment terrain features, access points and **Accessible** terrain.

## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - 1X HEAVY BARRICADE
A **heavy barricade** is **Heavy** terrain. Before the battle, you can set it up **wholly within** $4^{\prime\prime}$ of your drop zone, on the killzone floor and more than $2^{\prime\prime}$ from other equipment terrain features, access points and **Accessible** terrain.

## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - 2X LADDERS
**Ladders** are **Exposed** terrain. Before the battle, you can set up any of them as follows:
* **Wholly within your territory**.
* Upright against terrain that's at least $2^{\prime\prime}$ tall.
* More than $2^{\prime\prime}$ from other equipment terrain features.
* More than $1^{\prime\prime}$ from doors and access points.

In addition, an operative can either move through **ladders** as if they aren't there (but cannot finish on them), or climb them. Once per action, whenever an operative is climbing this terrain feature, treat the vertical distance as $1^{\prime\prime}$. Note that if an operative then continues climbing another terrain feature during that action (including another ladder), that distance is determined as normal.

## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - UTILITY GRENADES
When you select this equipment, select two utility grenades (2 smoke, 2 stun, or 1 smoke and 1 stun). Each selection is a unique action your operatives can perform, but your kill team can only perform that action a total number of times during the battle equal to your selection.

### STUN GRENADE
- **STUN GRENADE 1AP:** Select one enemy operative **visible** to and within $6^{\prime\prime}$ of this operative. That operative and each other operative within $1^{\prime\prime}$ of it takes a stun test. For an operative to take a stun test, roll one D6: on a **3+**, subtract 1 from its **APL** stat until the end of its next activation. An operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative, or if you have reached the total number of times your kill team can perform it.

### SMOKE GRENADE
- **SMOKE GRENADE 1AP:** Place one of your **Smoke Grenade** markers within $6^{\prime\prime}$ of this operative. It must be **visible** to this operative, or on **Vantage** terrain of a terrain feature that's **visible** to this operative. The marker creates an area of smoke $1^{\prime\prime}$ horizontally and unlimited height vertically from (but not below) it. While an operative is **wholly within** an area of smoke, it's **obscured** to operatives more than $2^{\prime\prime}$ from it, and vice versa. In addition, whenever an operative is **shooting** an enemy operative **wholly within** an area of smoke, ignore the **Piercing** weapon rule unless they are within $2^{\prime\prime}$ of each other. In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, roll one D3. Remove that **Smoke Grenade** marker after a number of activations equal to that D3 have been completed or at the end of the turning point (whichever comes first). An operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative, or if you have reached the total number of times your kill team can perform it.

## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - EXPLOSIVE GRENADES
When you select this equipment, select two explosive grenades (2 frag, 2 krak, or 1 frag and 1 krak). Each selection is a ranged weapon your operatives can use, but your kill team can only use that weapon a total number of times during the battle equal to your selection.

**Weapons:**
| Type | Name | ATK | HIT | DMG | Weapon Rules |
|------|------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
| ranged | Frag grenade | 4 | 4+ | 2/4 | Range $6^{\prime\prime}$, **Blast** $2^{\prime\prime}$, **Saturate** |
| ranged | Krak grenade | 4 | 4+ | 4/5 | Range $6^{\prime\prime}$, **Piercing 1**, **Saturate** |

## UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT - 1X PORTABLE BARRICADE
A **portable barricade** is **Light**, **Protective** and **Portable** terrain. Before the battle, you can set it up **wholly within your territory**, on the killzone floor and more than $2^{\prime\prime}$ from other equipment terrain features, access points and **Accessible** terrain.

- **Protective:** While an operative is **in cover** from this terrain feature, improve its **Save** stat by 1 (to a maximum of **2+**).
- **Portable:** This terrain feature only provides **cover** while an operative is connected to it and if the shield is intervening (ignore its feet). Operatives connected to the inside of it can perform the following unique action during the battle.

- **MOVE WITH BARRICADE 1AP:** The same as the **Reposition** action, except the active operative can move no more than its Move stat minus $2^{\prime\prime}$ and cannot **climb**, **drop**, **jump** or use any kill team's rules that remove it and set it back up again (e.g. **HEARTHKYN SALVAGER FLY**, **MANDRAKE SHADOW PASSAGE**). Before this operative moves, remove the **portable barricade** it's connected to. After it moves, set up the **portable barricade** so it's connected again, but the **portable barricade** cannot be set up within $2^{\prime\prime}$ of other equipment terrain features, access points or **Accessible** terrain. If this is not possible, the **portable barricade** is not set up again. This action is treated as a **Reposition** action. An operative cannot perform this action while within **control range** of an enemy operative, or during the same activation in which it performed the **Fall Back** or **Charge** action.
