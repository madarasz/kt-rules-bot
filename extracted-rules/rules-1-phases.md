# CORE RULES

Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a tactical skirmish combat game. Teams of specialist operatives will **Engage** in brutal firefights and back-and-forth close combats, where careful moving and positioning will be required to take cover and secure vital objectives.

## What You Need to Play

To play a game of Kill Team, you will need the following:

• A kill team – collection of Citadel miniatures (operatives) for each player.
• Their accompanying rules (available for free at warhammer-community.com).
• A measuring device in inches.
• A minimum of 10 six-sided dice (D6).
• Tokens and markers.
• A killzone – game board and terrain features.
• A mission pack.

## Game Sequence

Each game has a sequence that tells you how to set up the playing area, prepare your kill team and achieve victory. This can be found in `Game Sequence`.

The main step of the game sequence is the battle, where your operatives fight one another and you attempt to achieve victory. A battle consists of multiple turning points, and each turning point includes a Strategy phase and a Firefight phase. They must be completed in order and in full, at which point the turning point ends and the next begins. Repeat this process until the battle ends, as specified by your mission pack.

**Game Flow Structure:**
The game follows a cyclical pattern:
1. **START TURNING POINT** → 
2. **STRATEGY PHASE** → 
3. **FIREFIGHT PHASE** → 
4. **END TURNING POINT** → 
Then repeat from step 1 until battle ends.

# STRATEGY PHASE

## 1. INITIATIVE

• The player with initiative activates first in the turning point and decides the order of resolution for rules that would happen at the same time. In the first turning point, the player with initiative is determined by the game sequence of your mission pack. In subsequent turning points, the players roll-off and the winner decides who has initiative. However, if the roll-off is a tie, the player who didn't have initiative in the previous turning point decides who has initiative (this takes precedence over roll-offs and ties).

> **Designer's Commentary:** In some mission packs, you will also determine initiative when setting up the battle. The player with initiative decides the order for resolving simultaneous rules that happen before the battle begins.

## 2. READY

• Each player gains 1 Command point (CP); in each turning point after the first, the player who doesn't have initiative gains 2CP instead. Players keep CP until spent.

• Each player readies all friendly operatives.

## 3. GAMBIT

• Starting with the player who has initiative, each player alternates either using a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** or passing. The players repeat this process until they have both passed in succession. Strategy ploys are the most common **STRATEGIC GAMBIT**, but any rule labelled **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** can be used. You cannot use each **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** more than once per turning point.

> **Designer's Note:** CP (Command Points) are a valuable resource used to activate additional rules called ploys. An order token with the fighter side up shows an operative as **ready**.

# FIREFIGHT PHASE

The player who has initiative activates a **ready** friendly operative. Once that activation ends, their opponent activates one of their **ready** friendly operatives. The players repeat this process, alternating activations until all of one player's operatives are **expended**, in which case they can counteract between their opponent's remaining activations. Once all operatives are **expended**, the **Firefight phase** ends.

## WHEN A FRIENDLY OPERATIVE IS ACTIVATED:

### 1. DETERMINE ORDER

• Select the operative's order (**Engage** or **Conceal**). It has this order until it's next activated.

**Engage**: The operative can perform actions as normal and can **counteract**.

**Conceal**: The operative cannot perform **Shoot** and **Charge** actions, and it cannot **counteract**. However, it's not a valid target while in cover.

### 2. PERFORM ACTIONS

• The operative performs actions. While an operative is doing so it's known as the **active** operative.

• Each action costs **Action Points** (AP), and you cannot spend more AP during an operative's activation than its **Action point limit** (APL). In addition, an operative cannot perform the same action more than once during its activation – this is known as action restrictions. Some rare rules will change the cost of actions. Regardless of how many AP changes an action is affected by, the minimum is always 0AP. This takes precedence over all AP changes.

• You don't need to declare all your operative's actions when it's activated. Instead, your operative can perform an action, and then you can decide the next action after seeing its effects.

• If an action is declared or begun but it's not possible to complete, the action is cancelled. Revert back to the game state before that action. For example, if an operative has moved but cannot complete its move, return the operative to where it was before it moved, it hasn't performed that action and you haven't spent AP on it.

> **Designer's Note:** An operative with an APL of 2 could perform the **Reposition** (1AP) and **Shoot** (1AP) actions, totalling 2AP, but couldn't perform the **Fall Back** (2AP) and **Shoot** (1AP) actions, totalling 3AP. An order token with the darker side up shows an operative as **expended**. Counteracting isn't an activation; it's instead of activating. This difference is important; for instance, it means action restrictions won't apply.

### 3. EXPENDED

• When you've finished with your operative's activation, that operative is **expended**. While **expended**, an operative is not **ready**.

## COUNTERACT

When you would activate a **ready** friendly operative, if all your operatives are **expended** but your opponent still has **ready** operatives, you can select an **expended** friendly operative with an **Engage** order to perform a 1AP action (excluding **Guard**) for free. Each operative can only **counteract** once per turning point. That operative cannot move more than 2", or must be set up wholly within 2" if it’s removed and set up again, while counteracting (this is not a change to its Move stat, and takes precedence over all other rules). Counteracting is optional, so you can choose not to. In either case, activation alternates back to your opponent afterwards.

> **Designer's Commentary:** Counteracting is not an activation. This is an important distinction because it means rules like action restrictions do not apply.
