# Discord AI Chatbot RAG Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All code changes MUST follow Test-Driven Development:**
- Tests are written and approved by stakeholders BEFORE implementation begins
- Tests MUST fail initially (red phase)
- Implementation follows to make tests pass (green phase)
- Refactoring occurs only after tests pass
- No code ships without accompanying test coverage

**Rationale**: Testing drives design quality, prevents regressions, and ensures the chatbot behaves predictably across LLM model changes. Given our RAG functionality, test-first ensures retrieval accuracy and response quality are validated before deployment.

### II. LLM Model Independence

**The system MUST remain agnostic to specific LLM providers:**
- All LLM interactions occur through abstracted interfaces
- Model-specific code is isolated in adapter/provider layers
- Business logic MUST NOT depend on provider-specific features
- Configuration-driven model selection without code changes
- Standardized prompt templates work across different LLMs

**Rationale**: Provider independence prevents vendor lock-in, enables cost optimization through model switching, and ensures system longevity as the LLM landscape evolves.

### III. Security by Design

**Security MUST be embedded at every layer:**
- Input validation and sanitization at all entry points (Discord messages, API calls)
- Principle of least privilege for all service accounts and API keys
- Secrets management through environment variables or secure vaults (never in code)
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention on all external interfaces
- Audit logging for all security-sensitive operations
- Regular dependency scanning and vulnerability patching

**Rationale**: Discord bots are public-facing and vulnerable to prompt injection, data exfiltration attempts, and abuse. RAG systems introduce additional risks through document retrieval poisoning.

### IV. RAG Data Integrity

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation components MUST maintain data quality:**
- Document ingestion pipelines include validation and sanitization
- Vector embeddings are versioned and reproducible
- Retrieved context is traceable to source documents
- Retrieval quality metrics are monitored (precision, recall, relevance)
- Stale or outdated documents are automatically identified and flagged

**Rationale**: RAG quality directly impacts response accuracy. Poor retrieval leads to hallucinations or incorrect information, undermining user trust.

### V. Observable and Debuggable

**All system behavior MUST be traceable and diagnosable:**
- Structured logging with correlation IDs across service boundaries
- LLM prompts, retrieved documents, and responses are logged (with PII redaction)
- Performance metrics tracked: latency, token usage, retrieval time
- Error contexts include full diagnostic information
- Health checks expose system state and dependencies

**Rationale**: LLM and RAG systems are non-deterministic. Comprehensive observability enables debugging response quality issues, optimizing performance, and detecting security anomalies.

### VI. Automated Quality Gates

**All code changes MUST pass automated quality gates before merge:**

**Functional Quality**:
- Automated functional tests for all user-facing features
- Test coverage MUST be ≥80% for business logic
- All tests MUST pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Breaking changes require explicit migration documentation

**Non-Functional Quality**:
- Code complexity metrics enforced (cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity)
- Code duplication detection with threshold limits
- Maintainability index monitored and enforced
- Static analysis for code smells and anti-patterns

**Security Gates**:
- Automated security scanning for vulnerabilities (dependencies, secrets, SAST)
- Prompt injection pattern detection in test suites
- Authentication and authorization test coverage
- Security regression tests for known vulnerabilities

**Performance Gates**:
- Response latency benchmarks enforced (p50, p95, p99)
- Token usage monitoring and budget enforcement
- Memory and CPU profiling for resource-intensive operations
- Load testing for critical paths (Discord message handling, RAG retrieval)

**Quality Enforcement**:
- CI/CD pipeline blocks merge on gate failures
- Quality metrics reported in pull requests
- Trend analysis to prevent gradual degradation
- Automated alerts for metric threshold violations

**Rationale**: Manual quality review is insufficient for AI systems. Automated gates ensure consistent quality standards, prevent technical debt accumulation, and catch regressions early. LLM token costs and performance directly impact operational expenses, requiring continuous monitoring.

## Security Requirements

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- Discord bot token stored securely, rotated regularly
- API endpoints (if any) require authentication
- User permissions validated before executing privileged operations

**Data Protection**:
- User messages and chat history encrypted at rest
- PII detection and redaction before logging or storage
- Data retention policies enforce automatic cleanup
- Compliance with GDPR/privacy regulations for user data

**Input Validation**:
- All Discord messages sanitized before processing
- Prompt injection patterns detected and blocked
- File uploads (if supported) scanned for malware
- Content moderation for harmful outputs

## Development Workflow

**Code Review Requirements**:
- All changes require peer review before merge
- Security-sensitive changes require security-focused review
- Test coverage must not decrease
- Constitution compliance verified in review checklist

**Testing Gates**:
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage for business logic
- Integration tests: All LLM provider adapters tested
- Contract tests: RAG pipeline components validated
- End-to-end tests: Critical Discord interaction flows

**Deployment Approval**:
- Staging environment must mirror production
- Performance benchmarks validated pre-deployment
- Security scans pass (dependency vulnerabilities, secrets detection)
- Rollback plan documented for each deployment

## Governance

**Amendment Process**:
1. Proposed changes documented with rationale
2. Impact analysis on existing codebase
3. Team review and approval (majority consensus)
4. Version increment per semantic versioning
5. Dependent templates and documentation updated
6. Migration plan for non-compliant code

**Compliance Verification**:
- All pull requests checked against constitution
- Complexity and architectural deviations require explicit justification
- Regular audits ensure ongoing adherence
- New team members onboarded with constitution review

**Constitution Supersedes**:
This constitution is the highest authority for technical decisions. When conflicts arise between this document and other practices, the constitution takes precedence. Deviations require documented justification and approval.

**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE) | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-02
